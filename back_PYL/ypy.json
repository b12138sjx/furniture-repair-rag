Keeping this side of the MacBook Pro elevated will help the adhesive remover flow underneath the battery.\n步骤 39\nNow that your MacBook Pro is fully prepped, it's time to prep yourself.\niFixit adhesive remover contains acetone, a mild skin and eye irritant.\nWear eye protection when handling and applying the adhesive remover. (Eye protection is included in your kit.)\nDo not\nwear contact lenses without eye protection.\nProtective gloves are also included in your kit. If you are concerned about possible skin irritation, put your gloves on now.\n1条评论\n步骤 40\nPull off the black rubber stopper from your bottle of adhesive remover.\nTwist to loosen or remove the bottle cap before you cut the applicator tip.\nThis unseals the bottle and allows the pressure to equalize before you cut the applicator tip.\nIf you skip this step, the adhesive remover may spray out unexpectedly when the tip is cut.\nUse scissors to cut off the sealed tip of the applicator.\nCutting close to the narrow tip will give you better control so you can apply the adhesive remover in small amounts.\nTwist and close the bottle cap securely before you proceed further.\n2条评论\n步骤 41\nApply a few drops of adhesive remover evenly along the elevated edge of the outer right battery cell.\nYou don't need to use very much.

If this has you feeling overwhelmed, go look at\nthe 74-step guide for the 2015 15” MacBook Pro Battery Replacement.\nGeneralKire\n-\nI concur with that. Made the fix for a Macbook Pro 13\" 2014 some times ago and it looks really more difficult and stressing, especially with potentially destructive steps. I felt a bit lucky that it worked fine after that and since then...\nPierre Lagarde\n-\nOk I have the battery out but  where do you buy replacement adhesive strips? Everywhere I look they say they are for iphones or generic lcd repair.

It doesn’t look particularly difficult.\nTrent Dollarhyde\n-\nThese new MacBook Airs definitely have a simpler battery replacement procedure than other MacBook models. Whenever you need the M1 MacBook Air battery replacement guide, you can find it\nhere\n! Have fun fixing!\nCarsten Frauenheim\n-\nThis one is pretty easy - easier than other laptop battery replacements I've done. The hardest bit is getting the speakers out, you definitely need a hot air gun or hairdryer.\nTry it! What could possibly go wrong?\nMartin Cooper\n-\nI have a 2020 MacBook air that got water damage.  It was still working until the battery died but then wouldn't charge. I've replaced the screen as it had water marks and the battery looked like it had shorted out (there was blisters on it). So I replaced the battery too. But it's still not turning on after charging it overnight. I've doubled checked everything is connected inside. Is there's anything I need to reset or check to get it to charge up and turn on?\nRyan Boughton-Shields\n-\nRyan, you could look into trying a new\nUSB-C board\n, because if that doesn't function due to liquid damage then the new battery may not charge. Especially because you said:\nIt was still working until the battery died but then wouldn't charge.\nBest of luck in your repair!\nCarsten Frauenheim\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-142673\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/142673/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-142673\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/142673\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

It’s powerful stuff that can easily damage the system. Maybe, if you are able to get the battery out without the solvent, you can skip all the other stuff. I will say, however, that in my system, it seemed like the adhesive is real solid. It felt like I was pressing the card up against aluminum studs in the frame, until the solvent loosened it up. If you try to remove the battery without the solvent, be very careful not to use excessive force and warp your frame.\nEdward Harvey\n-\nSee the post I just added, it seems that this is all to be able to remove one of the speaker cables, which I don’t think in necessary. I really don’t like messing with delicate connectors and ribbon cables that I don’t have to.\nDaniel Christie\n-\nI have done this job before.  I remember that it was easy - did it on the kitchen bar.\nIn hindsight, I didn't have to take out all the crap.  I must have used a different guide.  Son of a gun, wasted time.  I easily got the battery out without \"adhesive remover\".  Hilarious if \"adhesive remover\" is acetone, a chemical availabe just about anywhere.  Note to self, iFixit needs to be second opinioned.  I think this guide is written to make it seem like you need a lot of special tools to do this job.  Not true - just a few drivers, usually provided with any battery.\nMatt Prater\n-\nI thought this too and didn't wanna do all that work with the solvent. All I removed was the battery connector and the trackpad cable before attempting to remove the battery. The adhesive Apple uses is bewilderingly strong. I thought I could pry it off with a strong paperclip and a screwdriver but it bent both. I ended up using the backend of a hammer and that worked surprisingly well. But it was super janky and I ended up puncturing the battery outer plastic. It didn't catch fire or anything but you can definitly smell the battery juices or whatever so i opened up my window. If you somewhat know what you're doing and accept the risk of setting fire to your house you\ncan\nget away with not using solvent but I highly recommend doing so as the battery I ended up pulling out of my MacBook is all mangled. And if you use the solvent you have to take everything out. Apple will be Apple.\nPip Watson\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-89284\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/89284/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-89284\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/89284\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

    "content": "MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Mid 2014 Battery Replacement\n简介\nUse this guide to safely remove the glued-in battery from your MacBook Pro with the help of an iFixit battery replacement kit. The adhesive remover in your kit will dissolve the adhesive securing the battery, allowing you to remove it with ease.\niFixit adhesive remover is highly flammable.\nPerform this procedure in a well-ventilated area. Do not smoke or work near an open flame during this procedure.\nTo minimize risk of damage, turn on your MacBook and allow the battery to fully discharge before starting this procedure.\nA charged lithium-ion battery can create a dangerous and uncontrollable fire if accidentally punctured. If your battery is swollen,\ntake extra precautions\n.\nNote\n: The solvent used to dissolve the battery adhesive will damage your speakers if it comes in contact with the plastic speaker enclosures. This guide instructs you to remove the speakers before proceeding to the battery.\nIf you're using the old-style iFixit adhesive remover with separate bottle and syringe (no longer sold),\nclick here for a slightly modified set of instructions.\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\nLower Case\nRemove the following P5 pentalobe screws securing the lower case to the MacBook Pro:\nEight 3.0 mm\nTwo 2.3 mm\n41条评论\n步骤 2\nLifting from the edge nearest the clutch cover, lift the lower case off the MacBook Pro.\nSet the lower case aside.\n10条评论\n步骤 3\nBattery Connector\nPeel back the warning label covering the battery connector.\n12条评论\n步骤 4\nUsing the flat end of a spudger, gently pry the battery connector straight up out of its socket on the logic board.\nBend the battery cables back and out of the way, ensuring that the battery connector doesn't accidentally make contact with the logic board.\n33条评论\n步骤 5\nAirPort/Camera Cable\n在这个步骤中使用的工具：\nTweezers\n$4.99\n购买\nUse a spudger or\ntweezers\nto pry the three AirPort antenna cables straight up off of their sockets on the AirPort board.\nThe cable connection points are fragile. Be careful to lift only on the connector, and not on the socket or cable.\nTo reconnect, align the connector carefully into position over the socket, and press it down firmly with the flat of your spudger.\n56条评论\n步骤 6\nUse the tip of a spudger to push the camera cable's plug toward the fan and out of its socket on the logic board.\nThe plug in the photo has six connections, but some models have twelve connections. The process of removing the plug from its socket is the same for both.\nIf the camera cable's plug won't come easily out of its socket on the logic board, fold back the rubber cover over the fan to gain access to the cable, then gently pull on the cable while using the spudger to gently push the plug out of its socket.\nBe sure to push parallel to the board, first on one side, then the other, to slowly \"walk\" the plug out of its socket. Do not pry up, or you will damage the socket.\n34条评论\n步骤 7\nInsert the flat end of a spudger underneath the rubber heat sink cover on the right fan.\nSlide the spudger underneath the length of the cover, releasing the adhesive.\nLift the cover and flip it back so that you can access the cables underneath.\n4条评论\n步骤 8\nUse your fingers to pull the AirPort/Camera cables up off the fan.\nThe cables are adhered to the fan, so peel them up carefully to avoid damaging them.\nCarefully de-route the cables from the plastic cable guide.\n2条评论\n步骤 9\nI/O Board Cable\nIf your I/O Board cable's connectors have\nnotches in the padding\n, you will need to\nrelease a locking lever underneath the notch\nin order to remove the cable.

If you use dental floss, make sure you at least quadruple it to have enough strength, and tie around two screwdrivers at the ends, otherwise it can be pretty painful. Finally, use a very small amount of the adhesive remover liquid to help fully remove the adhesive strips (making sure it doesn't go anywhere else), and install the new battery (step 54)!\nMarino Pagan\n-\nYeah, this method works great. Just wear gloves or your fingers might die.\nThank you for this recommendation!\nfelix schaetzler\n-\nYeah, I did the same thing, steps 1-4, then 34, then removed the battery with a mid-weight nylon cord. The nylon cord has just enough slip so that you do not need adhesive remover, it glides through the glue with a firm pull. I clamped a 1/2 scrap of wood to my workbench, placed the laptop behind the clamped wood as a stopper, which gave me a sturdy platform to pull against (it’s not quite as easy if you try to hold it down yourself, or even with another person). Just be sure to pull straight back and keep the cord low.\nI think the steps in this post are insane, and you risk damage to some vital parts that you shouldn’t even be touching just to remove the battery. But YMMV.\nMichael Gerfin\n-\nLate to the party, but putting the laptop at an angle, using 99%iso alcohol dissolves the adhesive really well. As well as a plastic pry bar from one of my tablet kits.

Sure, you can replace the battery easily enough. But there are MANY reports of Mac OS X not recognizing the new battery, no matter what you do. In my case I've had to put the old, swollen battery back. When I try to use the new one, it installs and connects perfectly, but Mac OS X spends all its time trying to find the battery. The laptop is practically useless because the system resources are consumed with trying to find the battery that it cannot see. Word to the wise—think 3 times before you try this.\nsabat\n-\nIt sounds like you purchased a faulty or poorly made battery.  There are many out there ranging from $25 to over $100.  You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to laptop batteries - and it is always a bit of a crapshoot with anything that is not OEM.  The Egoway on Amazon worked well for me.  About $75 - has good reviews and comes with a 1.5yr warranty.\nDerek Sava\n-\nWorks as it should. No problems with the new battery. The only thing which is different is, that in my MacBook Pro mid 2012 are Phillipps #000 and Y0 Tri Wing screws instead the above listet.\nChristoph Murauer\n-\nAfter replacing the battery with one from here a few weeks ago, it now says condition: replace now. battery wont last as it's supposed\nreyromero\n-\nWill it work without a battery installed?\njuanluks\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-10759\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/10759/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-10759\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/10759\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

It isn't spinning and the clothes are still wet.  The cycle isn't complete.  Perhaps the spin cycle isn't really doing its job; it spins but slower.  Maybe you have to run it twice. We will look at the possible causes and solutions.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外4个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nCheck whether your machine has a High-Efficiency badge or not.\nFor\nHigh Efficiency (HE) machines\n, refer to the solution directly under each possible cause. We will offer separate subheadings for\nTop Loaders\nand\nFront Loaders\nwhen the solutions differ.\nIf you've got an older top loader machine without a High-Efficiency badge, refer to the \"\nTraditional Machines\n\" sections, as these will cover older top loader machines mainly built before 2000. If there's no Traditional Machines section, just follow the main solution, as it doesn't differ from high-efficiency machines.\nFor the causes that follow, we assume:\nYour washing machine is plugged in and hasn't been accidentally unplugged. Check that it has power.\nIf it doesn't even respond to start, this isn't the place,\nyou need to consider why the machine won't start at all\n.\nThat it is able to fill with water. If so, turn the water off for now.\nYou ran a Reset sequence on your machine if it has electronic controls.\nNote\n:\nIf you replace a component\non a machine with electronic controls,  you should run a reset and a calibration/ recalibration, if available. Otherwise, you may not clear the error.\nOn to the causes!\nLid Switch / Door Latch Problem\nIn order to operate the lid or door must be closed and locked. These units have a latch as well as a door or lid switch.\nIf it won't lock, check the strike (the part that goes into the latch hole) for damage, like bending or breakage.\nIf the strike is OK just replace the latch assembly. This is usually pretty simple on either a top loader or a front loader.\nThe latch assembly is usually held by only a few screws, and access just involves opening the top of the machine on a top loader, or moving the door gasket/bellows out of the way on a front loader. Take out the old part, and install the new one and you're finished after you reassemble the other parts.\nUsually, these machines will give a diagnostic error code if they have a problem with the door switch or latch.  They may \"limp\" for a while where repeatedly closing the door or lid will allow them to operate, but a replacement part is the best solution.\nSome newer top-load units will give you a short window at the beginning of a cycle to add clothes, but they need to lock and receive a signal from the lock device indicating \"locked\" to continue.  Often there will be a door-locked light in the control area.  If the machine cannot detect a locked lid, it will not spin, although in some cases it might agitate.\nTraditional Machines\nThis is the very first item to check on your top load machine, especially older ones. These machines will often agitate with the top open, but will not spin. Some newer machines will neither agitate nor spin with the lid open. (handy for creating a soak cycle, just leave the lid open.)\nIf the machine will start agitating as soon as you close the lid, the switch is not the problem. (It knows the lid is closed.)\nYou will need to remove the top of the machine to get to the lid switch. In some cases, this might involve most of the cabinet as the top and sides are joined together, but the repair is simple.\nYou need to check the continuity on the lid switch when the lid is closed (the switch is in the operated position).\nUse a multimeter, set it to a continuity setting or Rx1 setting, and make sure you have continuity when the switch is operated.\nIf no continuity, replace the switch.\nIf the lid switch/door latch checks out, go on to the next item.\nBroken Belt / Loose Belt or Coupler Failure\nA number of High-Efficiency front loaders (Frigidaire/some Kenmore) and many HE top loaders (Whirlpool/Kenmore/GE) have drive belts that can break or slip. A few Traditional machines (GE/Maytag for example) have them as well.\nYou can check the belt tension (make sure the machine is unplugged) and if the belt is loose so that you can slide it by hand on the pulleys, you should replace the belt.\nIf the belt looks worn or is cracked or frayed, replace it.\nOf course, if the belt is broken, replace it.\nNote that you can remove the belt on machines with a flat-style belt by walking it off the pulleys to check it. This is not a symptom of a loose belt. You can do this with a V-belt but it's more difficult and you may pinch yourself.\nYou can pull the belt to one side while spinning the pulleys so the belt moves off the pulleys.\nTo reinstall it or replace it just reverse the process.\nTraditional Machines-Coupler\nOn some (Whirlpool, Roper, Kenmore) top loaders of the \"direct drive\" type, there is a flexible plastic and rubber\ncoupler\nthat connects the motor and transmission directly. This acts as a shock absorber for the drive train as well so it sees wear.\nThis is a very common point of failure for these machines. and they may still operate in wash cycles since the motor reverses to pump or spin.\nYou need to disassemble the coupler to check its condition which almost takes more time to describe than to do once you have access to it. You can put the washer on its back (be careful of or remove the drain hose) to gain access.\nDisconnect the pump from the motor (just snap on the clips).\nDisconnect the motor from the transmission same kind of clip but with a retaining screw.\nThe failures include:\nThe rubber part will be cracked or broken (you will find pieces sometimes under the machine).\nThe plastic \"spiders\" will be cracked. Beware, they can look good from the outside and may even spin the shafts.\nWhen disassembled check the \"double D\" holes in the plastic spiders. They can be rounded off by the motor or transmission shafts. The shaft will just spin in the hole and not drive the coupler (or do so poorly).\nIf the belt or coupler looks good, go on to the next item.\nSplutch and Shift Actuator or Clutch Failure\nNot a clutch, but a variable speed motor, is at the heart of the spin cycle on the newer top loader machines. The motor speed is increased gradually by a motor controller and the spin speed can vary from a low speed spin to a high speed spin.\nThe task of shifting from only the agitator or wash plate moving, to the whole basket spinning is done by the shift actuator (electric) and the splutch (a kind of toothed clutch). Many Whirlpool and Maytag units use this system. Some machines use a variation of the splutch that engages splines, we will refer to both as splutches.\nOne cause to check is to see if the shift actuator has failed or become disconnected so the splutch isn't shifted.\nYou can test the actuator motor on a Whirlpool machine with a multimeter set to resistance function. It should read between 2000-3500 ohms.\nYou can also check that the shift actuator arm is properly engaging the splutch operating lever and hasn't fallen out.\nIf the actuator looks rusty or water damaged, replace it.\nThe Whirlpool actuator also has a speed-sensing component that can cause the control board to get erroneous readings which will usually trigger a diagnostic code.\nAnother cause is the splutch itself has failed (plastic after all). There will often be a clicking or rattling sound when the machine tries to spin.\nCheck the splutch actuating lever with the actuator removed if it sticks or binds, replace the splutch.\nHere is a\nhelpful video on dealing with a splutch and actuator\n.\nHere is another\nvideo that demonstrates and explains the Splutch\nIf all these parts have checked out, go to the next item.\nTraditional Machines\nA cause of not spinning for these older top loaders is a worn-out\nclutch\n. The clutch allows the basket to begin spinning gradually and keeps the machine from destroying itself with sudden impact-type loads. This does cause the clutch to wear, and finally, it will wear enough that the basket won't even spin.\nOn some models (Whirlpool/Kenmore post-1986) the clutch band is involved in releasing the brake which holds the basket still when the agitator is operating.\nWhen this brake is released, the basket can spin with the clothes and allow the water to be extracted.\nWhen the clutch is worn, it both can't release the brake and/or can't grip the clutch drum strongly enough to stop slipping as the basket comes up to speed.\nYou will often see spinning that is just a slow-speed version of what it should be.\nOlder GE models will have the clutch built onto the motor shaft.\nOne sign of a worn-out clutch will be the fact that starting the basket spinning by hand allows the machine to spin.\nThis is a hazardous procedure as you have to bypass the lid switch; just start the basket turning a bit if you can. Often your little help will allow the brake to disengage and it will spin from there on its own\n. The machine will be able to then build up speed and spin fairly normally.\nAnother symptom will be clothes that take two spin cycles to actually be dry enough to put them into the dryer. Enough water is removed by the first spin, so that the basket is light enough to start and not slip as much on the second spin, and it goes to full speed.\nHere is a\nlink to an excellent guide on clutch band replacement\n. Since the band is the worn part, it is almost always the part to be replaced when the clutch fails.\nIf all these parts have checked out, go to the next item.\nWashing Machine Not Draining Fully\nThese machines frequently use a drain pump that is driven by its own separate motor.  Also because of higher spin speeds they are built with interlocks that prevent the washer from spinning at the highest speed until properly drained.\nA cause of not spinning may be the drain pump, as the machine won't spin at all until sufficiently drained.\nYou can manually drain the machine (buckets and towels are needed) and check if it will spin after it is drained.  If so, the drain pump is failing. If it won't spin, there is likely a problem with the water level sensing system.\nYou will want to check to see if the drain hose is clogged. If it is, clean it out.\nCheck to see if the filter is clogged, as the machine may not be able to drain properly with a clogged filter.  Make sure to clean the filter as that is a maintenance item in any event.\nThe drain pump itself may be clogged. You can disconnect the hose from the tub to the pump to check, especially on top loaders with no pump filter.\nThe drain pump may be failing. If so it will often make a loud grinding noise and may pump very slowly even with a known unclogged hose. If that's the case replace the pump.\nAdditional Steps for Front Loaders Only\nAdditionally, many newer front loaders will give diagnostic codes on their displays, which can help you to check various components.\nNote if you get errors regarding draining, like a code indicating a clogged drain hose, that may be the reason your machine refuses to spin.\nSometimes a failing pump is treated by the machine as a clogged hose. Check the error codes if they occur.\nIf it pumps OK and the hose is clear, go to the next item.\nTraditional Machines\nGE traditional machines\ncan\nsuffer from this problem, as somewhat later models used a drain pump and so had to monitor the water level so as not to try to spin a full machine, which would be hard on the drive system.\nOpen the front panel, and look for the tube connected to the side of the outer tub.\nRemove it from the connector, and look for obstructions or grime in the tube.\nYou can clean it with a small dowel or carefully with a straightened metal clothes hanger.\nOnce it's clean, try blowing through it. You should hear the water level switch click up in the control console area.\nIf the hose is plugged, replace it, or remove it from the machine to more completely clean it.\nYou should also try to clear the opening to the air chamber where the hose is connected.\nOthers of these older machines use a simple system for filling, and they don't usually suffer from this preventing spinning. In fact, some models would spin and drain at the same time. It doesn't hurt to clean the tube, though.\nIn many cases (Whirlpool Direct Drive for example) the washer has only one motor and it is directly connected to the pump, if the washer will run, it will likely drain, and not be prevented from spinning by water level issues.\nUsually, the pump is designed so that it will only pump out when the motor reverses from the direction it runs for agitation. Whirlpool added a neutral setting to the gearing in their transmissions so that the washer could pump out nearly fully before they started to spin.\nWater Level System Failure\nThis system operates using air that is trapped when the machine fills with water. As the water level rises, the trapped air increases in pressure and pushes against a diaphragm in the pressure switch or sensor. If the system isn't working correctly, It may cause your machine to behave very similarly to Not Draining Fully above.\nInstead of there being actual water, the problem is that the unit believes there is water present, because the pressure switch (water level sensor or control) is being fooled by clogs, or is defective.\nThe machine may try to drain and may have actually drained, but it still thinks it is full. Often this can arise because of a clog in the line that connects the pressure switch/sensor to the tub of the machine.\nOn older machines, the water level control will have a switch inside it. These can fail either mechanically or electrically.\nOn some newer machines, it will have a movable coil that allows the machine to sense the water level. This allows the machine to set the water level needed as it fills. It both senses how full the machine is and allows the machine to shut off the water when it has reached the desired level.\nThese newer machines usually will give error codes if there is a problem with the sensor.\nThe sensor can be checked in a diagnostic mode on the machine.\nMake sure that the sensing line or pressure tube is clear.\nOn many machines, the sensor is connected by a piece of flexible tubing to the tub or drum, and blowing through it is sufficient to blow out clogs.\nDisconnect it from the level sensor and blow strongly through the tube. you may hear a little gurgling and there may be a bit of resistance, but you usually can dislodge a clog this way.\nThere is a known problem with some top loaders (GE) which have a sensing chamber that is readily clogged because of manufacturing defects.  An opening on the chamber is manufactured partially obstructed.\nHere is a video showing the fix\n.\nOn some Kenmore HE3t  front load washers, a part called the Air Trap can get clogged with lint, and will also prevent the machine from spinning (you will get error codes). It is located at the back rear of the outer drum, and the water level sensor hose is connected to it. Here is a\nVideo of the process\n.  The video is kind of out of order so watch the whole thing if you choose to watch it.\nIf the sensor is OK, go on to the next item. if not replace it.\nCapacitor Failure\nOccasionally, the motor run capacitor will fail, and the machine will not spin (it may not run at all and just hum). To test it you will need to be sure it is discharged first.  Use a screwdriver to touch both contacts simultaneously to discharge it.\nYou can test the capacitor with a multimeter, either on capacitance function (best) or by setting it to a resistance function and checking if the resistance value starts low and increases across the terminals of the capacitor, until it indicates an open circuit.\nTub Suspension Failure\nTop Loaders\nSome top loaders can have a suspension rod failure which will cause the clothes to be thrown to one side of the machine and cause an unbalanced condition which will keep the machine from going into the high spin mode.\nYou can check the suspension by pushing the basket down either by the agitator or by the rim (if there's no agitator).\nIf the basket just moves back into position quickly that indicates a good suspension, Go on to the next cause.\nIf it bounces several times like a ball, this is a sign of failure in the suspension.  Replace the suspension rods on the machine as a group.  If one is failing, then others could fail soon as well.\nFront Loaders\nFront-load machines can suffer from a worn drum suspension.  Most front loaders use a shock absorber system, and when the shocks wear, the machine will become very bouncy because the shocks won't slow down the movement of the drum.\nYou can check to see if the shocks are still OK by giving the drum a downward push near the front it should move back smoothly with no bouncing.\nBad shocks will cause the machine to vibrate and the control board will show an out-of-balance condition. The machine may also indicate an error code associated with a failure in the drum suspension.\nSometimes the machine will start to spin but can't complete the spin because of an out-of-balance condition.  Usually, you will hear a great deal of banging and the machine will shut itself down. At times the machine\nTraditional Machines\nOn some Whirlpool direct drive design machines there are small plastic glide strips of a kidney bean shape that support the tub. When these glides wear out, they allow the tub to oscillate very violently with a mildly unbalanced load and can trigger an unbalance alarm on some machines which will stop the spin cycle.\nTub / Drum Bearing Failure\nA less common but still significant problem will be the failure of the tub/drum bearing or bearings.\nThis failure will usually be accompanied by grinding or groaning noises.\nThis is among the more involved repairs as it requires substantial disassembly of your machine.  You will need to remove the tub/drum.\nIf you choose to do this repair (it is long but not particularly difficult) you should\nmake sure to replace the tub/drum seal\nwhile you do the work, as the failure of this seal is usually connected to the failure of the bearings.\nHaving an assistant and space to work is usually very helpful.\nTop Loaders\nYou will need some specialized tools with a top load machine, like a spanner wrench or a special large hex wrench for the tub nut. You will need to be able to lift out the basket and then the entire tub assembly. This applies to Traditional machines as well.\nFront Loaders\nYou will likely have to disassemble the machine nearly completely. Generally, there aren't as many special tools needed, as you don't have two separate rotating pieces like a top loader. Room to work is a must and be prepared to organize the myriad of screws you will remove. Since you will need in almost every case to split the outer tub/drum, make sure to have a gasket for that joint on hand.\nSpider Failure (Front Loaders)\nThis is perhaps the most involved repair and frequently is not economically worthwhile on older machines which are more likely to suffer this failure. The failure results from corrosion of the arms of the spider, the device which ties the basket/inner drum to the drive shaft. This shaft is constructed as part of the spider.\nA sign of this failure is a clunking sound when the machine tries to enter the spin portion of the cycle. If the machine does load sensing with partial basket rotations, you might hear the noise at that point. You may also be able to tell this from a wobble when you spin the basket by hand.\nIt can be worthwhile if combined with a bearing replacement because it ensures that the drive shaft of the machine which is supported by the bearings will be new and clean, and less likely to cause wear on the new drum seal, the failure of which is what usually leads to bearing failure. Usually, the bolts that attach the spider to the tub/drum are installed with a permanent thread locker which requires heating to loosen, and the bolts may be unwilling to loosen. Purchasing a set of OEM replacement bolts (they are frequently stainless steel) is highly recommended if you choose to do this repair.\nHere is an excellent video\nshowing this replacement in an LG machine. The task is similar in other machines.\nMotor Failure\nThe motor can fail so that it won't run in one direction which can make it impossible for the machine to spin.\nA strong sign that there is a problem with the motor is if the unit will not run through a wash cycle, since the motor is involved in this action. Also, you may have heard humming from the unit with no action.\nMany units will also signal a problem with a diagnostic code.\nMotor Control Board Failure\nIf the motor runs on some cycles, but not others, that points to the motor control board. If it runs on cycles where it turns in the same direction as another cycle where it won't run, this strongly points to the motor control board. Some machines do not have a dedicated motor control board, so if that's the case, skip to the next item.\nControl Board Defective\nThe last resort, if all the other items have checked out, the control board is likely the problem.  Sadly, it isn't last because it's uncommon, but rather because it is costly. The service manuals on many machines will point you here after you check the other possibilities, and you may have gotten a diagnostic code for that.\nAdditional Information\nGreat Video\non many aspects of no-spin problems of HE Whirlpool top loaders.

You press the right button, turn the knob or pull the knob out, but nothing or nothing much. Amazingly there are a lot of fixes that are simple and straightforward. Also, you don't even have to dig into the machine to get going. Let's start with the simple solutions.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外2个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nBefore you go forward, here are a few questions to consider:\nDid you just run a very heavy load in your machine? You can have issues where the thermal protection for the motor trips after the motor has stopped. Give it a few minutes.\nIs your machine giving an error code? There are some codes that will prevent a machine from starting. Codes that deal with the door lock, or draining the machine are good candidates for no start. Your owner's manual will help with those.\nDies the machine fill with water, but then nothing more? Obviously, you have power, and the start button works so that the machine will fill, so skip to\nChild Lock\n.\nDoes the machine hum after it fills? Skip down to\nShorted Capacitor\n.\nNo Power\nYou might think we are kidding, but this is a common reason why your machine won't start. And it's easy to check.\nUnplugged\nMake sure it is plugged in. If it isn't this will likely fix things. If not go to Tripped GFCI.\nTripped GFCI\nMany laundry areas may have Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) protected outlets. Sometimes those outlets can be tripped by certain conditions (like moisture) and they act dead. There are two buttons on the face of many of them, one marked\nTest\nand the other marked\nReset\n.\nIf your outlet where the washing machine is plugged in doesn't have those buttons, see if another outlet nearby does. If you don't find any, especially on an older home, go to No Power at Outlet, below.\nUnplug your washing machine. Push the button marked\nReset\n. You may hear a faint click.\nPlug your machine in again.\nSee if it starts. If it does, you are done! If not, go to the next item.\nNo Power at the Outlet\nMake sure the outlet has power. Sometimes the Circuit breaker can trip because another device was plugged in like an electric heater or an electric clothes iron and overloaded the circuit.\nUse a lamp that you know works, and see if it turns on. If it doesn't then do the next item on this list.\nCheck the circuit breaker at the panel that feeds the outlet for the dryer.\nIt may be marked “Laundry” for example because your washer can share an outlet with a gas dryer. (Not an electric dryer)\nIs it tripped or off? If so, turn it on.\nDoes your machine start now? All done!\nNo Go? Let's keep checking stuff.\nControl Problems\nNo, not psychological ones, but your washing machine's controls. From the almost insulting to the tricky, we have:\nThe Start Button or Knob\nPush the start button. Many machines need to be told to start even after you set a cycle. Many older machines with timers need the cycle knob pulled out to start.\nChild Lock Is On\nThis can make your appliance just sit there when this is set, and not respond to any buttons you (or any children) push.\nLook carefully as often there may be a small light lit on the control panel, often like a baby or a smiling lock to tell you this is engaged. Some allow you to engage it when the cycle is running and it flashes CL (looks like an error code).\nCheck your operating guide or owner's manual to find out more about the indicator, and about how to turn the lock off.\nThis can often be accidentally set while trying to program the machine for a certain cycle and you push the \"magic\" sequence and suddenly it won't turn on.\nIf it is on, turn it off. You should be fine now.\nIf your machine doesn't have it or it isn't turned on, go to the next item, Broken Knobs or Shafts, below.\nBroken Knobs or Shafts\nA knob may have come loose on the shaft so it doesn't turn it but you think you are doing so. This applies mainly to older machines with knobs that don't cause indications on a control panel display.\nCheck all the knobs to make sure they are firmly on the shafts.\nCheck the shafts to see that they are actually turning something and not just spinning uselessly.\nIf these are all checking out, go on to the next item, if not, replace the knob or control as needed.\nLid Switch / Door Switch Failure\nWhen your washing machine won't turn on the most common component failure is probably the lid or door switch.\nOlder, traditional top-load machines have a lid switch that simply lets the machine know the lid is shut, and if the switch fails many of these machines will not start their cycle. Some might fill with water, but then they will stop.\nThe switch on this type of machine can be checked for continuity with a multimeter set to Ohms or Continuity function.\nWith the switch in the lid closed position, if it tests open (no continuity/or OL), it is defective and should be replaced.\nHere's an\nexample of an older style Whirlpool/Maytag/Kenmore Lid Switch replacement\nprocedure.\nIf your machine has a door latch incorporated with the switch, especially if it has electronic controls, it may need a signal from the latch that confirms that the door is locked before it will start. If it doesn't show a door-locked symbol or the door-locked light doesn't come on when you try to start the cycle, this could be an indicator of this problem.\nStart Switch Failure\nOlder traditional machines use a switch that is built into the cycle timer knob that can fail. It will show continuity when the timer knob is in the on position (pulled out in most cases) and often there is a diagram or schematic near the timer which will show what switch contacts should be closed when the machine is operating.\nYou can check the continuity of the switch with a multimeter.\nLook on the schematic (often included inside the washer control console) to see which contacts on the switch to check. There are usually contact numbers listed.\nIf no continuity, replace the timer. This can be fairly costly as it is kind of like the control board for such a machine.\nIf you have continuity go to the next item.\nNewer machines generally use touch-style controls and failures in these parts are much more difficult to diagnose. It may be that your Motor Control Board or Control Board has failed, which may be more likely.\nShorted Capacitor\nA failed capacitor will allow many non-motor functions to take place, including on some machines pumping out, but the drum or agitator won't move. A humming sound without any movement of the washing parts is a sign of a failed capacitor. It will be a small cylinder with two electrical connections located near the motor or sometimes on the back panel of the machine.\nWorn Motor\nYou can use a multimeter to check the various contacts on the motor for continuity and proper resistance. You should consult the diagrams in the console or any tech sheet that is in the machine so you can know the right values. As a rough guide around 5-10 ohms is reasonable for most motor windings.\nFaulty Motor Control Board\nAnother place to check if you don't even get a hum but the machine might fill is the Motor Control Board. This will usually be located close to the motor and be connected to it directly. Take a look for burnt components or signs of darkening on the board. if nothing is wrong, go to the next item.\nFaulty Control Board\nA dead control board makes for pretty much a dead machine. On machines with electronic controls, the control board is the brains of the system and if you have reached this point, it could be all that is left that is causing the problem.  If your machine will do little and you have checked all these other items, your remaining fix is the control board.\nRelated Pages\nWashing Machine Not Spinning\n2其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n2条评论\nBonsoir.\nEst-il possible de remplacer le bouton de mise en marche ?

Let's get that machine settled down. Here are some possible fixes.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外2个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nThis shaking usually happens during the spin cycle. Front-load machines frequently try rearranging the load using partial rotations to try and redistribute the load. They have gravity to help, so they can often fix the problem well enough themselves. Top loaders don't have this advantage, so direct human intervention is more frequent.\nIf this shaking or vibration is an ongoing thing with almost every load you run, you can probably skip the Load Unbalanced section and start at\nLeveling Legs\n.\nNote:\nWe will be referring occasionally to \"Traditional\" washing machines. These are older top-load machines that usually have knobs that you pull out to start the cycle, once you set it.\nLoad Unbalanced\nYou might think this is too easy, but a common user error is loads that are too large, or large single items, like a bedspread, that aren't distributed properly in the machine.\nStop the machine, open it, and rearrange the load. You might even want to add an item like a towel if there's only one item so that you can better balance things.\nIf the load is too large, the machine may not be able to spin at full speed, remove some of the wash items and try again.\nYou may avoid this in the future by finding out from your owner's guide, how much your machine can handle.\nStart the machine again and see if it will spin properly. If so, the problem is solved.\nIf the load is properly sized and fairly well distributed, go to the next item.\nUnlevel Legs\nYour machine may be rocking because it isn't steady on its feet. This is very important with front-load machines. They have to be steady and level.\nTry to rock your machine in a couple of directions and see which way it wants to move if at all. if It doesn't want to move that's helpful, because leveling will be that much easier.\nYou should put a small level on the top of the machine to check which way it is leaning. In case you aren't sure how to use a level, here's\na link to some information\nYou want to get it so it is level side to side\nand\nfront to back. So shift the level to read each direction.\nJust because it doesn't rock doesn't mean it is level.\nSome machines will have \"self-leveling\" legs (usually in the rear).\nTo get them to level, tip the machine forward and then gently let it back down on the rear legs.  You will feel them engage and the machine won't rock side to side as easily.\nThe mechanism can get rusted and sometimes a little oil or grease on the sliding bars and parts will help them to work. you can get to them by tipping your machine forward.\nOnce you have leveled the machine, start it up again and check it. If it spins smoothly, you are done, if not, go to the next step. If you have a top loader, go to\nSuspension Rods\n.\nShipping Bolts Not Removed (Front Load Washers)\nOccasionally the shipping bolts on front load machines can be inadvertently left in place. This results in a machine that can't absorb any vibration internally (the suspension is locked by the bolts) and instead tries to, almost literally, shake itself apart.\nFront-load machine shipping bolts go through the rear panel of the machine. Usually, you will see a number of hex head bolts (frequently 4) with plastic washers on the rear panel of your machine.\nCheck for these and remove them if they are present. Often the machine will have to come with a wrench for doing this.\nMake sure to save them, as they are recommended to be reinstalled for moving the machine to a new location. (Not for just sliding it around in your home, though.)\nHere below is a short video about shipping bolts\nFaulty Shock Absorbers (Front Load Washers)\nMost front-load washers have shock absorbers to steady the washing drum. The drum is usually suspended by large springs from the machine frame and the shock absorbers provide additional support and steadying so the drum doesn't bounce around. When they fail the machine will often vibrate heavily.\nA quick check involves giving the washer drum a downward shove and seeing if it bounces more than once. A more involved check requires removing the front and rear panels of the machine.\nRemove the front and rear panels of the washing machine. You will be able to see the shock absorbers. There are usually 4, sometimes only two, and occasionally three.\nCheck to see if any of them are leaking oil.\nA good check for such leakage is to rub the shiny shaft of the shock absorber with a clean paper towel and note if any oil soaks into the towel.\nAny leakage is a sure sign of failure, and if you find any replace all of the shocks.\nA further test is to detach one end of the shock absorber from the base of the machine and push the plunger in and out by hand. There should be considerable resistance in both directions.\nAny failure of this test, replace all of the shocks\nIf the shocks look good, go on to Springs, as front load units don't have suspension rods, only springs\nSuspension Rod Failure (Top Load Washers)\nThese parts are found on top load machines they allow the washer tub to be suspended and \"float\" inside the cabinet. or case of the machine. They are found on newer top-load models.\nAs they wear, both their springs fatigue a small amount, but mainly the damping effect of the assembly goes down. This is especially true with Whirlpool family (Whirlpool, Maytag, Kenmore, Roper, Amana) machines that have damping rods that use a small foam rubber insert in the damping rod. As it wears, it grips the rod less and less and the vibrations grow.\nThe main test is the bounce test.\nPush down on the washer tub or basket and release it quickly\nWhen you release it, note if it bounces or just returns to its starting position. If it bounces more than once it's defective, replace all the rods and associated components.\nSometimes you can improve the damping by applying a damping grease (one is called Nyogel 767A for example) to the rods where they pass through the plastic spring holder at the lower end of the assembly. If the plastic has begun to wear (the rod is floppy in it) just replace all the suspension rods. As mentioned, often the plastic isn't the damping device, it's inside the plastic housing.\nSince there are a variety of suspension rods and they all look similar, we will just list a few things to keep in mind if you are replacing or inspecting them.\nSome rods have Damping Devices (springs or elastic bands) which help to restrain the washer tub from moving sideways. They are attached to the rod and the washer tub near the top. These can break or stretch and become loose. They should have some tension on them when in place. If they are defective (loose or broken), replace them as a set.\nMany (most) rods can be removed from the top of the machine but there are a few which require you to unhook them from the top, and then tip the machine to remove the rod from the bottom. On machines with rods that can be removed from the top, there will be slots in the brackets on the sides of the tub so the rod can go through the slot to be removed.\nWhen replacing the rods, do one rod at a time, otherwise, the weight of the tub and motor assembly can be difficult to lift in order to install the new rod in place.\nSome manufacturers will include rods that are designed to be installed in specific locations (front or rear) on the machine. Make sure you note this.\nHere is a\nlink to a guide for replacing these rods on a Whirlpool top loader.\nHere is a link to a\nvideo with more explanation on Suspension Rods\nSpring Failure\nAlmost every washer has springs attached to the washing drum or tub.  It has to be able to move, but not too much. A trampoline spring tool can be very helpful if you have to replace any springs.\nFront-loaders\nOn front-load machines, there are usually two springs that suspend the outer drum, one on each side. If one of these fails it will be pretty obvious, as they are easy to spot when the top of the machine is removed.\nTo check the springs on front loaders you will need to remove the top cover of the machine.\nMake sure the springs are attached and not bent, broken, or corroded. If they are ok go on to Balance Ring\nTop Loaders\nTop load machines (especially of the traditional type) often have large numbers of springs, generally located underneath the washing machine tub. Because they are underneath the tub, they are more prone to rusting.\nThe springs are usually attached in symmetrical patterns around the outer tub. Some machines also have a spring to balance the weight of the motor, and it is usually. toward the back of the machine\nTo check these springs you will need to remove the washer case or cabinet.\nSprings can be corroded, but usually the corrosion is a surface issue and doesn't affect the spring. You will want to examine springs that are heavily rusted, as this can cause the coils to stick together, and the spring won't function correctly.\nCheck for broken or disconnected or loose springs.\nIf you find one disconnected, check the attachment points to see if they have failed. Usually, the spring is stronger than the place it's hooked onto, so look closely. If the attachment point has failed, you may be able to\nIf you find a loose spring, there may be one that was supposed to balance it that has fallen off or broken.\nSprings can wear over time and you may see thinning on the spring at places where the spring rubs at its attachment point. If you see a spring with more than 1/4 of its wire diameter worn off, replace all the springs.\nCheck the attachment points carefully for wear and corrosion as well. Corrosion has a much greater effect on the strength of the usually thin metal that the springs attach to.\nApply a small amount of grease at each of the points where the spring is metal to metal with its attachment point. it will help prevent future wear\nIf the spring has a plastic part that it is connected to, make sure the plastic isn't cracked or worn.\nIf the springs check out go on to the next step.\nSuspension Wear Items Failed (Top Loaders)\nNo, these aren't the suspenders you could wear on your trousers.  They are found on top-load washing machines that don't use suspension rods.\nThey are small, but essential, parts of the top load machine's suspension that will cause major problems if they have failed. They are essential to smooth controlled movement of the internal parts to absorb vibration.\nThe repairs are a little more involved, but they often have a nearly miraculous result. A machine that was shaking, banging, and sliding across the floor, sounding like it was headed for recycling, suddenly becomes docile. These parts are a very likely cause if you have noticed the banging and shaking getting worse over time. You will have to do considerable disassembly of your unit to check them, but if you have it open when checking the springs, it isn't that much further to go. The parts include:\nSnubber Rings\nSnubber Pads\nWear Pads\nDamper pads\nSkate Plate\nSnubber Ring\nIt can be a little tricky to determine if the snubber ring is worn without disassembling your machine substantially. The wear pads also require some disassembly to get a good look to see if they are worn. It's worth a go when you have reached this point because\nThere are several types of Snubber Rings, and there are online resources for performing the repair. Here are two examples of a common snubber ring\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih0_ve1C...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CKHrxNB...\nWear Pads and Snubber Pads\nWear Pads are found on Whirlpool/Kenmore Traditional direct drive machines. Here's a video showing how to replace them. You can also use this video to see the rectangular Snubber Pads. They are mounted just like a wear pad. It is a good idea to do both when you have the machine open.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg8xTKR9...\nDamper Pads\nDamper Pads are found on older Maytag units and are somewhat involved in replacement. The repair is not especially difficult but requires substantial disassembly and gluing of new pads in place. Here are two videos to show how.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJt5MrMK...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxp9cIPB...\nSkate Plate\nThis part works in conjunction with Wear Pads and Snubber Pads. It glides on the wear pads and can become dislodged. When that happens the machine can sound like it is destroying itself internally. Here's a video to show the problem and the fix.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-o2JcdY...\nIf your suspension is looking OK then go on to the next item.\nSpider Support Arm Failure\nThis applies to both front and top loaders with Direct Drive motors. You can check for this failure by rotating the drum by hand. If you hear a clicking noise, or you notice that the drum on a front loader seems to wobble as it rotates (you can move the door gasket aside temporarily to watch it is a sign that your drum support arm is damaged or broken.  This is often a repair that is fairly involved, so depending on the age of your appliance, it might be uneconomical to repair it.\nOther Causes\nBalance Ring Failure\nOften liquid is filled on many top-load machines, if the liquid leaks out, the machine will vibrate. Check to see that the liquid is still present. Some front-load machines use concrete weights that can crack and shed pieces. Check to see that they are intact and that there is no debris under or inside the machine.\nFaulty Tub Bearings\nBoth top loaders and front loaders can suffer from vibration if the bearings that support the washing tub or drum are failing. This is more prevalent with ball bearings, as water intrusion or wear will create substantial vibration.\nDirect Drive Motor Failure\nSome Samsung units have experienced failure in the direct drive motor, where a magnet on the rotor comes loose. This can cause vibration.\nWorn Drive Block\nThe drive block is a part that drives the agitator on top load machines. It is located inside the wash tub and can be accessed by removing the agitator.  When it is worn, it can lead to vibration of the machine when spinning because the agitator will rattle.\n2其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n3条评论\nTengo un lavarropas dream compacto, no arranca el programa, si funciona el tablero\nMonica Ponce\n-\ntiembla mucho la lavadora como le hago para arreglarla\nJulio cesar Valenzuela encinas\n-\nTengo una lavadora hoover no arranca el lavado ni ningún cicló\nMagaly\n-"

Let's get you emptied out and going again.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外一个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nYour first move is to try to run a drain and spin cycle. If you don’t know how, now’s the time to get acquainted with your owner’s manual. If you don’t have one, you can usually go to the manufacturer’s website and download one. Now some steps:\nOnce the machine is trying to drain, check the following items:\nIs water coming out of the drain hose? Is it flowing fully or just a little trickle. Is there no water?\nIf there’s no water, can you hear the pump running? If so, is it noisy? A running pump with no water coming out points to a clog or an impeller problem.\nKeep in mind that many older top loaders use only one motor so the pump may be driven by the same motor that drives the basket. If the machine spins, but won’t pump out, it points to the pump having failed. Many machines won’t spin if they aren’t empty or nearly so.\nIs there a leak anywhere? This might be a symptom of a cracked pressure hose or air dome. Sometimes the tube that connects to the water level sensing device can fall off or crack and that will cause a leak.\nGet the items you will need to drain the machine.\nYou will need a bucket, a shallow pan that you can pour from and some rags. You may need to drain the machine more than once, so keep these items handy.\nFor top load machines, you should first bail out the machine.\nYou may be able to use a wet or dry vacuum to pull most of the water out of the tub. Otherwise, any small container and a large bucket to dump it into is essential.\nAfter bailing, you will need to open up the machine cabinet, get to the pump, and disconnect the hose running from the tub to the pump.\nBe ready for some water with a container to catch it and towels or rags.\nIn some cases, the pump is mounted on the tub, and you may be able to disconnect the drain hose from the pump to drain the machine.\nHave a bucket and lots of towels or rags, as you might just have to let the water go onto the floor.\nIf the machine didn’t pump out (very likely), you need to drain it.\nHere is a guide for a front load machine\nthat will show you an example of how. You will need more than a bowl for the water in this case!\nNow we look at the causes! There are two main systems involved when your machine will not pump out. One is the pump system, the other is the water level sensing system. We will start with the pump system and its components.\nFailed Pump\nThe most obvious problem. It doesn’t pump out because the pump doesn’t work. There are two main points of failure for the pump. On most front loaders, it is the motor and the impeller. This applies to many newer top loaders as well, but some older models will have a pump either driven directly by the basket drive motor or driven by a belt from the drive motor.\nFor a front loader, we will start by\nremoving the pump\n.\nHere's a guide to that on a typical front load machine\n. There might be some differences, model to model, but the basic idea is the same.\nPump Motor (red) on Pump Body\nImpeller on Pump Motor\nStart by checking the pump motor. This is a likely failure when you don’t hear the pump run at all.\nInspect the pump power connectors and make sure they are seated properly.\nUse a multimeter to measure the resistance of the winding. It should be between 10-40Ω.\nIf it is outside of this range, replace the pump motor.\nIf OK, remember to seat the connectors fully when you reinstall the pump, then go to the next item.\nYou can also check the bearings to see if the motor moves freely,\nThis is more difficult because the permanent magnet motor turns by hand in impulses or steps, so it is harder to judge the condition of the bearings.\nIf you hear grinding noises when you turn the motor, you should replace the pump motor.\nIf it just spins freely with little resistance to turning or turns with a mix of free spinning and impulses, it's defective and should be replaced. Contrary to what you might expect, such free spinning means the impeller has come loose on the shaft or the drive magnet has come loose.\nNext, check the impeller. If you can hear the pump running, but no water is being pumped, you may have either a loose impeller (mentioned above), a broken impeller, or a clog. We will look for clogs later.\nInspect the impeller for damage like chipped or missing blades.\nRemove any lint or other debris that is on the impeller or wrapped around it.\nCheck the pump body for clogs or debris. Small laundry items can become lodged in the pump body and block flow. If you find any such items, remove them. We will want to check for other clogs as well. (One clog often leads to another.)\nCheck the wiring to the pump. There are connectors in that wiring path that should be disconnected and reconnected to make sure they are fully engaged. If possible, trace the wires back to the main control board and check for continuity.\nMany older top loaders will have a pump that is driven by the main motor. In one very popular and long-lasting design, the pump is driven by the main motor and is connected to one end of it. Further, this sort of pump has to be replaced as a unit, the impeller is sealed in. Sometimes the connection between the motor and the pump breaks, and the motor will spin, but the pump won’t. You will want to do the following:\nRemove the hose that connects the tub to the pump (you may have had to do this already to drain the machine).\nCheck the pump inlet for clogs, Small items can occasionally make their way down the hose and lodge in the pump..\nRemove the pump and check to see if the impeller is jammed or broken by attempting to turn the pump.\nAlso, check to see if the drive portion has been broken, sometimes, the portion where the motor shaft enters the pump can crack and cause the pump not to turn.\nIf the pump is belt-driven, make sure the pulley is on tightly\nIf everything now looks good on the pump, move on to the next step.\nClogged Hoses\nIf the hoses are clogged, little or no water will be pumped out of your machine. Clogs can happen either upstream or downstream of the pump or sometimes in the pump body itself. We have already checked the pump body, so the next check is the drain hose.\nRemove the drain hose from the wall drain or standpipe.\nNote if the hose has been put more than 4 inches (10 CM) into the drain pipe or if the hose outlet is over 8 feet in elevation. Correct either of these issues if you find them, as many washers will not pump out properly if they are present..\nIt may be easiest to\nremove the drain hose\nfrom the washing machine entirely so you can check the whole length for clogs. The linked guide will give you an idea of how to do this on many front load machines (it’s from an LG machine).\nUse a dowel or a wire with the end folded over to run through the hose to make sure there are no clogs.\nRinsing out the hose, if possible, after you do this is a good idea as you may have dislodged debris as you checked for clogs.\nIf you find a clog, remove it.\nGo on to the next step.\nThe above steps also apply to the drain hose on most top load machines. In some cases, the drain hose will be attached to the back of the machine,+ and the machine will have an internal hose that runs from the pump to the back of the machine. Check both. Some will have a preformed hose with a bend that makes it more difficult to push a stick or wire through the hose. A flexible plumber’s snake can be used, but you can also try a garden hose outside.\nThe other place for hose clogs is the tub to pump hose. Once the pump is removed, this hose is already disconnected at one end, so it is not too hard to check. The following guide shows an example of such for a front load machine.\nHere is a guide\nfor removing the tub to pump hose.\nOnce the hose is removed, check for obstructions, especially things like small hair accessories, small socks, etc. Look through the hose. Also, if possible, look at the outlet from the tub where the hose was installed.\nTop load machines are less likely to suffer from these clogs, but small items like hairpins can work their way through the basket and lodge in the hose or pump and cause lint to accumulate and clog the hose.\nIf you have found one or more clogs, you can choose to reassemble your machine at this point and test it. Given that the machine takes time to reassemble and disassemble, you may find it worthwhile to check the water level sensing system.  But this is a lower priority if you have found substantial clogs.\nWater Level Sensing System Malfunction\nWe look at these items next because if there is a problem with them, the system is likely to cause the machine to display an error code on newer machines, so you probably would already be alerted to them. Since your problem is a failure to drain, it is less likely that the washer will indicate a failure to fill.\nPressure Hose\nThe main culprit in these malfunctions is the pressure hose.\nPressure Sensor and Pressure Hose\nAir Dome and Pressure Hose\nAny air leak, either at the fittings or in the hose itself, will cause problems.   As the air pressure from the air trapped by the water bleeds off, the machine will eventually think it is empty (no pressure = no water). It may try to top itself off with additional water and could overflow.\nExamine the entire hose, especially where it is clipped to the machine for breaks or cuts or to see if it has become disconnected or loosened at either end.\nOn front-load machines, leave the hose connected to the pressure sensor, disconnect it from the air dome, blow into it, and see if you find an air leak.\nThere could be a loose connection to the pressure sensor, so remove the hose there and inspect it for cracks or for an enlarged opening.\nThen reconnect the connector at the air dome and then remove the connection at the pressure sensor, and blow to check the air dome for clogs.\nOn top load machines, disconnect the hose from the pressure sensor (usually located higher up in the machine; on older models, it is in the console). Blow into it and see if the tube is clogged.\nIf possible, remove the tube and inspect it for cracks or a worn end where it connects to the air dome or chamber on the side of the tub. Any leaks in this hose are a big problem.\nYou can usually blow directly into the pressure sensor, but on machines with a sensor, the machine will give an error code if the sensor has gone bad.\nA clogged hose will also cause problems because sometimes it may detect the water filling the tub, but it can't detect when it empties, as the clog won’t let the trapped air out. You have checked for clogs in the above steps. If the hose checks out, move to the next step.\nAny problems:\nIf the hose is cracked, replace it\nIf the hose fits loosely on the connector at each end, you can try hose clamps, but replacement is wise because the hose has probably stretched.\nIf the air dome has cracked, replace it.\nIf the hose is clogged, clear it or replace it.\nNote: some GE top load washers had a problem with the connection for the pressure hose on the air dome on the side of the machine clogging because it was improperly molded. They issued a Service Bulletin (HL 01-17) and a Training Bulletin (TB 10-17) for it.\nPressure Sensor\nThe Pressure sensor can fail and usually will cause an error code on the display of your front load machine and those top load machines that use one.\nCheck the resistance of the sensor, a common value is between 21 and 23 Ω. If it's shorted (0Ω) or far outside this range, replace it. The sensor uses a coil that changes the resonant frequency of a circuit as the diaphragm in the sensor moves. It’s not actually a switch.\nPressure Switch\nGenerally, pressure switches are found on older machines. You can tell if you have a pressure switch because if you blow into it, it should make an audible click. Frequently, the water level control will be a pressure switch with a know that adjusts when the switch triggers.\nYou can use a multimeter to test your pressure switch to see if it functions properly. You will likely find two contacts on the switch that will show <1Ω on your meter and will show\nOL\non the meter when you blow in the switch. If blowing doesn’t work or the switch shows\nOL\nall the time on the meter, replace the switch.\nWiring Harness and Connector Problems\nThis is the last stop before the control board. Testing the wiring harness to see if all of the components are testing good, before replacing the control board is a wise precaution, as control boards are expensive and wiring does fail.\nCheck especially at places where the wires may flex with the movement of the machine, at the place where the wire is secured at each end. Breakage will likely occur there.\nBefore replacing the control board, you may want to try disconnecting and reconnecting all of the cables that are connected to the control board.\nThen, test the function of the washing machine.\nIf you have a service manual or tech bulletin, you can check the connections that have to do with the drain pump and the pressure sensor.\nIf the harness doesn't check out for continuity, replace or repair it if possible.\nIf the harness checks out, then go to the next step.\nTimer Failure\nOn older machines, the timer may fail, either the motor driving the timer or contacts within the timer. This is a less likely failure but one that you may encounter when everything else checks out. The motor failure will probably result in the washing machine stopping in mid-cycle.\nYou might find that by manually advancing the timer a tiny bit, the machine will continue to complete the cycle. In other instances, you may discover that the contacts in the timer have failed, and the timer will not allow the machine to pump out. You will need to understand both the timer chart and the machine schematic, so you might need to consult a repair professional.\nMain Control Board\nThe end of the line. You have tested the other components, and they check out. Replace the control board.\n1其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n1条评论\nNo está el drean blu\nMax Milton Castro\n-"

This guide aims to assist you in identifying and fixing prevalent washing machine issues from the comfort of your home.\nMatt Zieminski\nUnderstanding Your Washing Machine\nEach issue is structured into three essential parts:\nProblem:\nIdentifies the specific issue you're experiencing.\nWhy It Happens:\nProvides a brief explanation of potential causes.\nHow to Fix:\nOffers step-by-step solutions to resolve the issue.\nReady to Tackle the Problem?\nArmed with this guide, you can approach washing machine troubleshooting with confidence. Let’s dive in and get your washer running smoothly again!\nStains on Clothing\nWhy It Happens?\nClothing stains are often caused by various factors, including washer component malfunctions or external sources. The widespread use of synthetic fabrics and improper washing techniques contribute to this issue. Frequently, these stains originate from cooking oil or grease and are initially invisible. The oil in the fabric attracts dirt during washing, leaving clothes spotted and dirty after the cycle.\nChemical Safety\nAdhering to safety guidelines is crucial when dealing with stain removal to minimize the risk of fires or injuries:\nAlways follow instructions on stain removal product labels.\nStore these products in their original containers and out of children's reach.\nClean any utensils used for stain removal thoroughly.\nAvoid mixing chemicals like chlorine bleach and ammonia, as their fumes are hazardous.\nNever wash items exposed to flammable substances like gasoline or dry-cleaning solvents, as they pose a risk of ignition or explosion.\nUse flammable solvents or chemicals outside the home to prevent vapor-related explosions.\nHow to Fix\nHere are some general rules for stain removal from clothing:\nAddress stains promptly for easier removal. Older stains might be permanent.\nDetermine the stain type, fabric type, and age before treatment.\nUse cold or warm water for stain removal; hot water sets stains.\nWhen using bleach, choose one that's fabric-safe and always dilute chlorine bleach.\nTest stain removers on a hidden garment area first.\nFor effective stain treatment, work on the stain from the opposite side of the fabric on a clean surface.\nTreat protein stains with enzyme presoaks or meat tenderizer.\nUse dry-cleaning solvents in well-ventilated areas, away from ignition sources.\nTreat alcoholic beverage stains immediately with cold water before washing.\nFor blood stains, use cold water with an enzyme presoak, and appropriate bleach depending on the fabric color.\nRemove chewing gum with ice and a nonflammable dry-cleaning solvent, then wash.\nTreat coffee or chocolate stains with a warm water detergent paste.\nRemove milk-based stains with dry-cleaning solvent and wash.\nFor antiperspirant and deodorant stains, use hot water and laundry detergent, followed by ammonia and oxygen-type bleach paste for persistent stains.\nSoak fruit stains in cool water, avoiding soap, and use an oxygen-type bleach and ammonia paste for stubborn stains.\nApply lemon juice and salt to iron or rust stains and expose to sunlight, or use a commercial rust remover.\nTreat dairy product stains (other than milk or baby formula) with enzyme-containing products.\nFor crayon or candle wax, remove excess wax, use a warm iron between paper towels, pre-treat, and wash.\nAddress chocolate or grass stains with enzyme-containing presoaks and appropriate bleach in the washer.\nYellowing in Fabric\nWhy It Happens?\nYellowing in fabrics can arise from various sources, such as:\nInadequate removal of body soil\nUse of water softeners in laundry\nPresence of hard water or minerals like iron\nAccumulation of body oils on garments\nWater supply contamination from decaying vegetation\nHow to Fix\nFor Body Oil and Soil Removal\n: Increase detergent use and wash with water at 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Enhance the frequency of bleach use in the laundry cycle.\nWater Softener Impact\n: Reduce detergent amount to the level that still effectively removes soil. Regularly add bleach to the wash to combat yellowing.\nHard Water and Minerals\n: Implement a water-conditioning system. Consider draining and flushing the water heater tank. Avoid using chlorine bleach for hard water or iron stains.\nBody Oils on Garment\n: Apply a paste of detergent and water to the affected area. Leave it for 15-30 minutes before washing.\nYellowing from Decaying Vegetation\n: Increase detergent and bleach usage, especially for white fabrics, which generally react positively to bleaching.\nFabric Softener Stains\nWhy It Happens?\nFabric softener stains have become more common with the recommendation to add some softeners during the wash cycle rather than the rinse cycle. These stains can affect both synthetic and cotton fabrics.\nHow to Fix\nTo remove fabric softener stains, pretreat the area with liquid detergent. Then, wash the garment according to the instructions in the use and care manual.\nLint\nWhy It Happens?\nLint is primarily cotton fibers that detach from cotton garments and tend to cling to synthetic fabrics. This can misleadingly appear as a washer performance issue. Overwashing is another common cause of lint, leading to accelerated wear and tear on clothes. Washing garments for more than one minute per pound of laundry with normal soil levels is unnecessary and can contribute to lint problems.\nHow to Fix\nTo manage lint on synthetic fabrics, proper sorting of laundry is crucial:\nSeparate cottons from permanent press and knits.\nDistinguish between light and dark colors.\nAlso, ensure proper drain hose connections:\nKeep the drain hose length under 10 feet.\nEnsure the hose height does not exceed 8 feet.\nAvoid kinks in the drain hose.\nIf excessive draining persists, consider:\nInspecting and cleaning the drain pump filter located at the washer's bottom front.\nChecking the drain pump's functionality.\nLooking for obstructions in the drain system or the washer's water circulation system.\nWasher Will Not Fill With Water\nWhy It Happens?\nThis issue can occur due to various reasons, including power supply issues, mechanical faults, or obstructions in water flow.\nHow to Fix\nBasic Checks\nPower Connection:\nEnsure the washer is properly plugged in and turned on.\nHose Inspection:\nCheck for any kinks or blockages in the fill hoses.\nScreen Cleaning:\nClean the screens in the fill hoses to remove any clogs.\nWater Supply Verification\nConfirm that the water supply to the machine is active and at sufficient pressure.\nVoltage Check at Mixing Valve\nUse a Volt-Ohm Meter (VOM) to check for proper voltage at the mixing valve.\nAlternative Check:\nSet the washer to \"fill\", turn on the timer, and feel or listen to the valve. Vibration or humming indicates proper voltage. Exercise caution around live circuits.\nValve Inspection\nIf the mixing valve is energized but not admitting water, inspect for and remove any obstructions.\nFill Switch Continuity Test\nPerform a continuity test on the fill switch and replace if necessary.\nTemperature Selection Switch\nVerify the temperature selection switch is functioning correctly.\nTimer Functionality\nRule out any issues with the washer's timer.\nLid Switch Check\nEnsure the lid switch is making proper contact.\nKey Takeaways:\nStart Simple:\nBegin with basic checks like power connection and hose inspection.\nElectrical Safety:\nWhen checking voltage, always prioritize safety.\nDetailed Inspections:\nInvestigate specific components like valves, switches, and timers.\nContinuity Tests:\nUse a VOM for accurate diagnostics.\nIssues with Water Level or Temperature\nWhy It Happens?\nReversed hot and cold water hoses.\nInadequate hot water supply.\nFaulty water level switch.\nMalfunctioning thermal element in a thermal-type mixing valve.\nFaulty temperature selection switch or timer.\nOverall timer malfunction.\nHow to Fix\nCheck Hose Connections:\nEnsure hot and cold water hoses are correctly connected.\nAssess Hot Water Supply:\nVerify the hot water supply is adequate and consistent.\nWater Level Switch:\nTest and replace the water level switch if necessary.\nInspect Mixing Valve:\nFor thermal-type valves, check the thermal element.\nTemperature Selection Switch:\nExamine and replace if faulty.\nTimer Functionality:\nInvestigate and rectify any issues with the timer.\nMatt Zieminski\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n2条评论\nEn una lavarropas LG Smart Invertir 9.0 kg al encender aparece en su panel el error LE, y no carga agua ni trabaja la lavadora.\nHéctor Cáceres\n-\nNo estoy seguro, pero puedes checar conexiones que no estén flojas por las vibraciones al lavar, sensor de peso, talvez el seguro de la tapadera, las válvulas y ver si no esta tapada alguna manguera o presente alguna fuga.

You turn it on but no water comes in. Maybe the water comes in really slowly. Or maybe it's only just the cold or hot water that flows. What can you do? There are a whole bunch of things to check. Let's go see a solution.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外3个贡献者)\nNo Power\nAn embarrassing moment, but embarrassing is also cheap!\nFirst just be sure it's all the way plugged in. Older non-electronic machines can often give no real indication that they are unplugged.\nAlso check the circuit breaker for the laundry outlet. Maybe something tripped the breaker and it wasn't reset.\nIf you find one of these problems see if the machine will operate properly. Try running a spin cycle, if it starts, you know that's good. See if the machine has water now, if not, keep going.\nWater Supply Is Off\nAnother embarrassing moment, but sometimes we forget that we or someone else shut the valves off.\nLook carefully at the valves. Do they have straight lever handles, or do they have round handles?\nIf they have lever handles, make sure the handle is in line with the outlet of the valve. They should only turn one-quarter turn as they are ball valves.\nBelow is a picture of the ball-type valves.\nIf they have round handles they are likely globe, gate, or angle stop valves and will take multiple turns to turn off and on.  Try turning them counterclockwise. You may also have valves that have T-type handles like an outdoor faucet. They work the same way.\nIf they will turn keep going until they stop turning. It may be tricky to get this right if your valves are upside down or the handles face to the side or worse still away from you.\nAngle stop valves pictured below.\nIf they won't turn, try turning them clockwise. If they turn, they were already on, and you can just leave them alone.\nTip: It is a good idea to leave this type of valve about 1/8 turn from fully on. It helps to verify the actual valve position because you can just turn it toward open that little bit, and won't be as readily fooled that it is stuck in the off position\nCheck both supply valves using the above procedure to be sure they are both on.\nYou might also want to check to see if the main supply to your home is on, though you would likely have noticed if your water was turned off.\nMany water heater installations will have valves for both hot and cold at the water heater. Make sure all vales at the water heater are on.\nBall Stop Valves\nangle stop valves\nClogged Filter Screens\nYour machine will have filter screens located in the water inlet connections of the machine.  There will also frequently be screens on the water supply hoses. These screens can become clogged and make the water flow slowly or essentially not at all.  If you are on a water well, you will likely have sediment buildup and possibly mineral buildup, especially if you have hard water.\nPlugged filter screens are a very common cause of slow filling.\nTo check them do the following:\nTurn off the water supply (you know how from the step above)\nDisconnect the hoses at both ends. (Have a rag or a bucket handy to catch the water that is in the hoses.)\nLook at the filter screens on the hoses, if they are dirty, clean them thoroughly. If the screens are badly corroded, or there are heavy mineral deposits, replace them.\nLook at the screens on the machine. If they are dirty, clean them. If not go on to the next step.\nIf possible remove metal screens carefully with needle nose pliers for cleaning. Some plastic screens may have a tab to allow you to wiggle them out. Pliers will likely break plastic screens unless you use them very gently. Mineral deposits will be hard to remove\nYou may have to clean some screens on the machine if they aren't removable.\nYou can use an old soft toothbrush and something to gently squirt water at the screens, to rinse away the bits. An old empty dish detergent bottle is handy for this. Mineral deposits may be very hard to remove and you may need to replace the screen.\nIf you see the screens are broken (plastic is prone to this), they should be replaced.\nIf the screens were dirty, and you cleaned all the screens, reconnect all the hoses, turn the water back on, and test the machine. If it works, you're done! If not, go to the next step.\nHere's a picture of where the filter screens are on a water inlet valve connection.  The small red circles are where the screens are. You can't see the screens very well here.\nFaulty Lid Switch\nIf the lid switch on your machine might be keeping it from filling, a quick check is to run a spin-only cycle. If the machine will run then the lid switch is good, and you can go to the next step. If not, you should investigate the switch as it is a common failure point, especially on older machines. Here is a\nlink to helpful information on investigating your lid switch\n.  Information for testing on older or Traditional machines is down that page a bit located\nhere\n.\nHere is a\nlink to a guide for replacing the lid switch\non an older machine\nWater Inlet Solenoid Valve Failure\nThe most common problem that prevents your machine from filling with water, is if the solenoid switch fails. You may notice that your machine may fill with only hot or only cold water or seems to fill slowly. This is a sign that the corresponding solenoid coil or even the corresponding valve itself has failed.\nFirst try filling the machine with water using cold water only. If nothing happens you know that the cold water solenoid is likely bad or the cold water valve plunger is stuck.\nNext try filling with hot water only. If nothing happens, the same problems could have happened with the hot valve, or your machine thinks it is already full.\nIf there are problems with filling with either hot or cold, you will need to move your machine so you can open the cabinet (case). Make sure it has been drained first as water is heavy.\nNext, shut the water off, disconnect the hoses and unplug the machine.\nOnce you have it open, look at the place where the water hoses connect to the machine. There should be a device that has some wires connected to two cylinders on it. The cylinders are solenoid coils and you can use a multimeter set to ohms to check the resistance of the coils.\nIf it's over about 1,500 Ohms. the coil is defective and the valve should be replaced.\nIf it reads very low resistance or zero, the valve is also defective and should be replaced. This condition might also have blown an internal fuse on some models.\nIf the coils look ok, go to the next step.\nHere is a picture of a Water Inlet Solenoid Valve. The red arrows point to the contacts that you should check with the multimeter in this picture. The circles at the end of the arrows show how the contacts are paired on each coil.\nWater Level Control / Pressure Switch Failure\nAnother reason your machine won't fill is because it thinks it is already full.  If your machine is still filling slowly at this point you can rule out the water level control, as it won't cause slow fill, only no fill or overfill. The water level control is actually a pressure switch or pressure sensor (newer machines) connected to the washtub or drum.\nIf the machine refused to fill at all (no water), the water level control may be the problem. On older machines, it will have a knob attached to the control panel for adjusting the water level. This knob works by adjusting how much air pressure is needed to cause the switch to operate. Switches inside supply power to the inlet valve and if they don't do that (like burned out or stuck) you get no water.\nOn newer machines with electronic control, a sensor coil in the device is connected to the diaphragm to monitor the water level, and the machine sets the level itself according to the cycle settings. These don't often fail, unlike switch contacts.\nIn either case, if the pressure tube that is connected to the control is plugged, the control can be fooled into thinking the machine is full.  Let's start.\nLook for a device that has a single small rubber hose attached to it that is either on the control panel with a knob attached or is on a bracket inside the machine with no knob.\nThe device on the control panel will likely have two sets of switch contacts.  Disconnect it from the machine, and remove it. You can check for continuity on these contacts. If there is none replace the control.\nThe device on the bracket won't have switch contacts. The resistance of the coil is usually about 20 ohms.  The best test is a self-diagnostic routing that the machine can run.\nYou should next check the rubber tube that you disconnected by blowing through it gently. if it is clogged, and you can't free the clog by blowing with more force, you can disconnect it from the tub or drum and check the connection for accumulated debris. This is a common problem for no-fill issues.\nHere is a picture showing a pressure switch on an older machine. The switch is circled in red, the red arrows point to the small pressure tube that is connected to the washer tub and that sometimes gets clogged. Alongside is a control or sensor from a newer machine with a small tube in blue.\nOlder\nNewer\nFaulty Control Board\nAt this point, no water likely means a failure with the main control board if everything else has checked out.  You might want to consult an appliance technician for diagnosis before replacing the board, as it is usually fairly costly.\n3其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n3条评论\nLa lavadora no enciende\nYolandaPalaciosMoreno\n-\nCómo puedo arreglar mi lavadora MAYTAG.No enciende.\nYolandaPalaciosMoreno\n-\nVerifica fusible, algún cable de alimentación cortado\nFLIA GALINDEZ\n-"

It's leaking all over the floor.  Puddles are forming.  You need to track down why.  We can walk through the causes of a leaking washer.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外2个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nShut off the water\nto the washing machine\n.\nIt will help you to get everything dry, and you may notice that the wall-mounted shutoff valves leak when you are doing this. You have a few questions to ask once the water is off. When you are ready to search for a specific leak turn the water back on.\nWhere Does It Leak?\nLook carefully for where the source of the leak seems to be, front or rear for example. Dried mineral or detergent deposits or rusted areas can give a clue.\nIt is essential to dry everything off first because then the leak is easier to spot.\nYou may even notice things like the location of the moisture as you are drying the machine.\nWhen Does It Leak?\nIf the machine\nleaks constantly\n, running or not, that points to a leak that is under constant pressure. Most of the pressure-type leaks will be to the rear of the machine.\nThe first place to check is the valves and hoses and connections that supply water to the machine. If you find any leaking, try to tighten them and check again.\nWatch carefully, as water can run down a hose from a leaking connection, and mislead you as to the leak location.\nSometimes putting your hand around a hose will allow you to see if water is running down a hose from above, as the water will run over or onto your hand.\nThe next place to look is the solenoid water valve that is internal to the machine.  If the valve body is cracked, or a seal has failed, it will drip. Replace it.\nYou may have a machine that fills the drum or tub with water even when shut off.  This is a failed solenoid valve and you should just\nreplace the valve\n.\nIf the machine\nleaks only when running\n, observation is your best tool.  Observing your running washing machine may be like watching paint dry, but it may also allow your floors to dry!\nDoes it leak when the machine is filled with water?\nThis could be related to the machine overfilling and overflowing onto the floor.\nThis is more common with top-load machines because the open top gap with the cabinet allows a ready path for overflow.\nThey also operate with higher water levels than are usually encountered with a front load machine, so there's less room for any sort of malfunction with the water level control.\nGo to\nOverfilling\nfor more information\nThis may be a problem with your solenoid valve, and the internal hoses that are connected to it. Go to\nInternal Leaks\n, below.\nYour detergent dispenser may have a leak or clog, either in the body of it or in the attached hoses. This will be most apparent in the portion of the cycle where the machine is filling or sending water through the dispenser. Go to\nInternal Leaks\n, below.\nDoes it leak during the wash cycle?\nThis can arise from overfilling, causing splashing in a machine with an agitator, which ends up on the ground.  Go to\nOverfilling\ndown below.\nIt could be the tub seals.\nOn top load machines, the seals see water continuously and so they can leak significantly. The movement of the agitator makes this leak more apparent when the machine is running.\nOn front-load machines, the leak is less pronounced but will be found at the rear of the machine which is a handy clue.\nGo to\nTub Seals\nfor more info.\nIt can be the water level tube has cracked or come off.  This will be a significant leak, especially if it slips off on a top load machine, and will likely lead to the machine overflowing as well.  Go to\nOverfilling\n, below.\nFront-loaders often have a vent for the drum which will drip if the valve for the vent sticks. If your leak is from the drum vent (usually on the upper rear of the machine) go to\nDrum Vent\n, below.\nIt can also be from a failing door seal on a front load machine.  Go to\nDoor Seal\nfor more steps.\nDoes it leak when the machine is draining?\nThis is the most common failure because the volume of water is large, and there are many places where leaks can occur simply from wear and tear. Also, the lint in the water can cause clogs which lead to leakage.\nIf the leak is near the front, you should check the pump for leakage.  Check the filters located at the front of the machine as well. Start at\nPump and Filter\nbelow.\nIf toward the rear, it is likely a problem with the drain hose. We will walk through those possibilities below at\nDrain Hose\n.\nThe problem may also be a clog in your home plumbing system.  This will likely leave the biggest puddle, and the surface of the wall behind the machine will likely be wet. Go to\nDrain Hose\nfor more.\nPump and Filter Failures\nPump\nThe problems with the pump can be either hose-related, crack-related, or seal related.\nThe hoses can shift on the pump, especially if they are held only by barbs on the pump.  If the pump has been replaced recently this is a common failure.  Reinstall the hoses and add clamps if there aren't any. Make sure the clamps are tight if they are already present. Some drain pumps (GE) will have the hoses glued in place, and if they have been disturbed, you may need to re-glue them.\nCheck the pump body for cracks.  Sometimes the body will crack and one way to check is to push on the body and outlets of the pump while it is in place.  Better still is to remove it and inspect it closely. if you can observe it while running that is the best of all, especially if you have dried everything first. You will need to turn on the water for this check. This is hard to do on a front loader. You might want to place colored rags or towels near the pump to help spot leaks while the machine is running.\nThe seals on some pumps can wear out and the pump will leak at the drive shaft.\nThe bellows (hose) from the drum or tub to the pump can be cracked or have been sipped off partially.  The leak will be substantial and almost continuous when the machine is operating.  You may feel water there that has run down from above so make sure you dry everything and test.\nFilter\nMany machines will have a filter that is located near the pump and has a number of seals that can leak.\nLike the pump, there are also hoses attached to the filter, that can either come off or become cracked. If you find any cracked hoses, replace them.\nIf there is a drain hose attached to allow the machine to be drained of residual water, it is another source of leaks, especially if the plug in the hose becomes worn. Check to see that the plug is snug, and if not, replace it.\nLeaks can also occur after cleaning the filter if it is improperly installed.   Remove and reinstall the filter, and make sure it goes fully into place.\nCheck the filter housing body and lid for cracks, if there are any, replace it.\nClogged Drain Hose\nIf you are here because the symptoms point to a problem with the drain hose, check these items...\nCheck the hose for clogs especially downstream of the anti-siphon, usually located on the rear bulkhead (panel) of the machine. Some machines will not have these, or will just have a raised portion of hose inside the machine.\nCheck the drain hose for cracks.  Some hoses are made of corrugated plastic material rather than rubber material and can be damaged or cracked.  Stretch the hose and flex it and look carefully.\nThe home plumbing system may have a clog or partial clog, which will cause it to overflow when the pump starts emptying the machine.  Since the flow is quite fast from the pump, a partially clogged pipe may not drain quickly enough and will overflow where the drain hose enters it. The wall near the drain pipe may be wet too. If you see these signs clear any clogs from the plumbing and then test.\nOverfilling\nYour washing machine can have too much of a good thing when it fills too much. When a machine is overfilled, water can more easily escape.  You will have to observe carefully and see if you can check the water level in the machine. Turn the water back on to start.\nThis isn't too difficult with top-load machines as it is simple enough to open the lid and check.\nYou might have to unplug the machine so that it won't try to pump out first before allowing the lid to open.\nTop loaders with agitators can sometimes splash enough that the water gets out of the tub and onto the floor.\nAlso too much detergent can cause suds that overflows onto the floor.\nMany front-load machines can be observed through the front door which is usually transparent.  They also will not allow the door to be opened unless the machine can sense that it is empty, or the water level is low enough.\nTo check this you should first check the tube that leads to the water level switch/sensor.  Make sure it isn't clogged.  You can clear it by blowing through it. If you can't blow through it, you should remove it and either clean or replace it.\nYou should also see that the pressure switch or sensor is operating correctly.  It should click when you blow air into it; lung pressure is fine. Some may be adjustable. If no click replace it.\nA number of front-load machines use a device that varies the frequency of a resonant circuit by moving coils with a diaphragm. This has no contacts (so no click) and thus is very reliable, you can usually check it by getting into a diagnostic mode for your particular machine.\nTub Seal Failure\nOn a top load machine, a leaking tub seal poses a larger problem, as it will both leak substantially and will lead to corrosion of the drive system located below it. If the tub seal is leaking it is a fairly involved, but not impossible fix.\nA clue will be a splash or spray line of water on the inside of the washing machine at about the level of the bottom of the drum.\nThe leak may also show up below the center of the tub as well. from leakage when the driveshaft is turning more slowly.\nIf you see these conditions, it will be worthwhile to try to operate the machine with some of the covers or cabinet pieces removed so you can observe the leak directly, as you want to be sure of what's wrong before you do the repair. Turn the water back on and let the machine do its thing. If you see the leak, replace the seal.\nInternal Leaks\nThere are two main sources of internal leaks, other than items we have already addressed, like the pump, drain hose, and filter. These include the detergent dispenser and associated hoses, and the water inlet solenoid valve. You will need to operate the machine with water, so turn the water supply on.\nDetergent Dispenser Damage\nFront-load washers generally have the detergent dispenser located on the front of the machine, either in a small drawer or under a movable cover. Top load washers have them as cups located around the upper portion of the machine under the lid, or they may also have a drawer, usually located under the lid of the machine.\nThis dispenser can be damaged or cracked and will leak when water is running through it as the detergent is added to the wash water. If it is cracked, replace it.\nThis can happen while the machine is filling or during the wash cycle.\nYou should watch the operation of front load machines with the top cover removed. Top-load machines can be observed with the front cover removed. To avoid shock hazards avoid touching internal parts of the machine while it is operating. Look and listen for leaks.\nFeeling the dispenser and underneath it\nwith the machine unplugged\n(no shock hazard) can help you locate leaks.\nThe hoses from the detergent dispenser to the drum can also become partially clogged and will cause the dispenser to overflow.\nIf you see this overflow condition,  remove the hoses and clean them out fully. Reattach them afterward.  Test the machine.\nDetergent and fabric softener can deposit residues that will obstruct the hose (there may also be small parts dropped in by small hands too that can contribute).\nThe hoses from the detergent dispenser to the washer drum or tub can become detached and will cause a substantial leak. Reattach the hose if possible, making sure you check the dispenser and tub or drum for damage that may have caused the hose to come loose.\nThe hoses leading to the detergent dispenser can be improperly attached, or cracked and will cause a leak, observation is the easiest way to spot this. If you find a leak there, determine the cause and\nreattach or replace the hose\n.\nSolenoid Valve Cracked\nThe solenoid valve and attached hoses can leak.  Since, in general, the water is fed from the solenoid valve to the detergent dispenser, you likely have checked the hoses already.\nThe valve itself can leak from improperly installed hoses or cracks in the body or outlets.  An overtightened clamp can break plastic parts (one reason for spring-type hose clamps being so common in this application) Occasionally, a seal can fail near the coils, so check thoroughly.\nFaulty Vent Bellows Hose\nCheck the condition of all of the vent bellows hose attached to the washer drum.  Look for cracks or tears.  Make sure it is securely attached, that the clamps are snug, and that the ports on the drum and vent outlet are not damaged.\nDoor Seal Failure\nThis is found exclusively on front-load machines and can fail in a number of different ways.\nThe seal can have slipped out of place, which will cause a leak.\nThe seal is dirty which can prevent it from sealing properly.\nThe seal is damaged or punctured, which will also cause a leak.\nYou can look for signs of a leaking door seal, mainly by the location of evidence of leaking, it will be near the front of the machine. Especially with punctures, the location of deposits can help you pinpoint the leak.\nClean the seal thoroughly, especially parts that will be in contact with the door.\nWhile cleaning, check the seal to see that it is installed correctly and not rolled or improperly seated\nOnce you have checked for proper installation, stretch the seal, and look all over it for tears or punctures. If you find one, replace the seal.\nFaulty Drum Vent\nThe drum vent may incorporate a valve that allows for air to circulate into and out of the drum.  It may leak either because the valve is stuck, because improper detergent is being used, too much detergent is being used, or because the machine is improperly leveled.  If the machine is leaking from the rear vent opening check the following things.\nMake sure you are using HE-type detergent.  Normal detergent will create too many suds and the excess will frequently leak out the vent. Use the right detergent.\nToo much detergent (even HE type) can have the same effect as Non-HE detergent.  Make sure you follow the manufacturer's recommendations.\nMake sure your machine is properly leveled.  Your operating manual should have instructions for checking this.\nIf you have checked these causes, then another check is to remove the vent bellows from the drum, and check the valve located there on some machines. If it sticks open it can cause leaking. You should also make sure the bellows aren't torn or damaged as that will also cause leaking.\n2其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n1条评论\nWhy is my washing machine stopping when heating, making the electricity life button stop, but it works perfectly with the cold wash?\nNo leaking is visible\nmrs.iacono\n-"

This page is meant to help you find a way in, and find out what went wrong. Then we will look at some solutions, once we know what went wrong.  Don't despair, you can repair! Most of the issues are centered around failures in the door locking mechanism which is a straightforward fix. Some issues are encountered with defective control parts;  in a few cases, these can be caused by the latch failing as well.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外2个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nWe are starting with you looking at your locked washing machine.  First of all, there are a few questions to answer.\nIs your machine a top loader? If not, go to the next question.\nMost top-load machines don't have a latch device that is released by pulling a handle. They use the weight of the lid to hold it closed.\nYour best bets for releasing the door:\nUnplug and wait 5 minutes\nGently bang on the door near the latch location.\nTry to alternately lift and push in gently on the door near the latch location. Do this for a minute or so.\nTry to remove the top of the machine to gain access to the latch.  This is often complicated on a top-load machine and usually involves removing the control console, and then releasing the top.  You may find that it's better to have a service person do this.\nIf you get in you should be able to manually release the latch.\nIs your machine still full of water?  Some machines will not unlock the door if they aren't pumped out first. If it's emptied of water, but stuck, go to the next question.\nYou will need to drain your machine first to see if it will unlock.\nMany front-load machines have filters that are located down low on the front of the machine, these can be opened carefully to allow the machine to drain.\nSome machines will have a drain tube in the same spot, which can simplify the process.\nYou may be able to use a wet-dry vac at the filter opening (or the drain tube) to rapidly remove the water.  Be careful doing that at the filter opening, because the seals or other parts of your washer might be damaged if you apply the vacuum and seal off the opening.\nIf you just drained it from the filter or drain tube on the front of the machine, plugged it in again, waited and it opened, then you know the problem is not the latch, it's likely the pump.  You should replace it.\nDoes your washer have a handle on the door that moves a latch hook on the door to allow it to open? If not, go to the next question.\nIt may also have a mechanism that locks the door when the cycle is started too and may cause a delay, so give it 5 minutes before trying to open the door\nIf that handle mechanism is broken (it will likely be kind of floppy when you operate it) you will have to use some tricks to get the door open. We'll walk through those below at\nReleasing the Latch\n.\nDoes your washing machine have a lock mechanism that locks the door while a cycle is running, but releases it once the machine is turned off?\nYour machine may have a delay feature that doesn't allow the door to be opened for a short time (like a minute or two).\nThis is normal behavior and you can just wait 5 minutes to try again; it may be slow or sticky.\nTry giving the door a sharp rap where the latch is located to release it.\nIf it opens; you're set, but be prepared to replace the latch as the sticking will only get worse.\nYour machine may have a solenoid that is failing or the mechanism is worn.\nIf you are still locked out, go to\nReleasing the Latch\n.\nReleasing the Latch\nThere are several methods for releasing the latch on your machine.\nSome should not be used on certain machines as they can cause damage\n.\nIf the hook or catch is a\nfixed part\non the door and doesn't move to operate,\nyou will have to open the top (or some other part) of the machine to get at the latching mechanism.\nDo Not Try\nany of the other methods below; you can damage your washer. Go to\nRemove the Top\nand start there.\nIf the hook or catch\nmoves\nto open the door (there's a movable handle on the dryer door that normally operates it) here are two ways to release the door, the String Method and the Card Method.\nIf you don't know, it is best to open the latch by removing the top and accessing the latch.\nThe String Method\nThis method involves threading a string or cord around the door to form a loop and allows you to move the hook by pulling the loop.\nThe string should be\nstrong\n, as the pull you must exert needs to be substantial.\nThe best strings will combine flexibility with strength and resistance to breakage.\nStrings made from nylon or other plastic will usually prove the most useful, and less likely to damage anything; some examples: Line for a weed trimmer, strong fishing line, a nylon guitar string, or small diameter insulated wire will work.\nBraided cords can work, but may be difficult to thread in the tight space around the door, as they may tend to hang up on obstructions more easily.\nYou may break the cord while pulling, so having a backup is almost a necessity.\nYou need to know which direction the handle moves the hook to know which way to put in the string.  The string will be formed as a loop when it is in place.\nIf the handle pulls away from the hinges of the door, you will pull on the string loop from the hinge side, as the catch will be moving in the direction of the hinges.\nIf the handle pulls toward the hinges of the door, you will pull from the edge of the door away from the hinges. You will be at the hook side of the door.\nIf the handle pulls in another direction (like downward) you will just have to remember which way the catch moves (sorry).\nThread the string around the door so the string will move the catch in the right direction to release the door.  Connect the ends so it forms a loop that will be easier to pull.\nPull the string very firmly.  It may help the catch to release if you apply gentle inward pressure on the door.\nIf this doesn't work, you can always try to access the catch by opening the machine and manually releasing it.\nThe Card Method\nYou can release catches that move toward the hinges by using a\nstiff plastic card\n(like an old credit card or gift card) and slipping it into the space between the door and the front of the machine by the latch.\nIt may be helpful to sort of \"thread\" the card down from above the latch location and slide it downward until it is opposite the catch.\nYou may have an easier time of getting past any parts which stick out on the front of the machine and keep you from getting the card to where the catch is.\nWhen the card is in place push the card toward the hinges.\nIf the machine opens, you may be able to make a temporary release arrangement.\nRemove the Top\nIf there is no movable hook catch on your washing machine, or you have tried the previous steps without getting in, you will need to access the latch mechanism from inside the machine.\nTo do so you will need to remove the top panel of your machine.\nMake sure it is unplugged before you do this.\nYou might be able to remove a kick panel on some machines (Kenmore HE3 for example) to get at the latch.\nThere are usually two or occasionally three screws located at the rear of the machine, that you will remove, and then slide the top of the machine toward the rear and lift it off.\nYou should then be able to see the latch assembly. You can release the catch from the latch manually either by pushing a release button or inserting an Allen wrench into a hole on the latch, or pulling a release ring (this last might be best accessed from below by removing a kick panel)\nTemporary Workarounds\nWith washing machines, the show must go on. Maybe you can go for a few days, but unless you like going to a laundromat, or borrowing a friend's machine (really machine\ns\n), unless you want to tote wet, heavy laundry back to your home to dry it, it is nice to use your machine.\nYou can make a temporary release for your door if it is just a latch problem.\nInstall a loop of more flexible cord around the catch hook and lead it outside the door.\nThis may be through a hole where the handle belongs if the hook moves toward the hinges.\nOn machines that have the hook move away from the hinges of the door, you will just leave it hanging on the outside edge.\nYou can attach a ring or other device to allow you to pull more easily.\nNow that your door is open and your clothes are freed from their wet prison, we need to figure out how to keep them free.  Now we move toward fixing the problem.\nThe Causes:\nThe reasons your washer would lock you out are varied and involve several different parts.  One set involves the door latching mechanism itself (catch and latch), the next involves systems that control the door latch (water level), and the last set involves the main control board. Top loaders should go to\nFaulty Handle (Movable Catch)\nIf your machine doesn't have a handle that moves a catch on the door, go to the next step.\nIf your machine has a handle that is supposed to move the catch and doesn't do so anymore, these next steps are for you.\nIf the handle still moves the catch, it may be that it isn't quite moving it far enough.\nSince this is generally not an adjustable part, nor is the latch, your best move is to replace the handle and catch assembly, as it is more likely to have worn.\nThis failure is a common one, especially since it involves a mechanical item subject to wear and fatigue.\nSince the problem is likely not going to cause more damage right away you can use a\ntemporary workaround\nso you can keep using your machine while you get the parts.\nIf replacing the handle mechanism didn't fix the problem, you will need to go to the next step.\nFaulty Catch (fixed or movable catch)\nIs the catch piece bent? You can snag the catch with laundry and inadvertently bend it so it wont be able to release properly from the latch.\nThis is more likely to happen with a non-movable catch.  Most movable catches are mounted with a spring and it gives them more flexibility.\nIf the catch is bent, replace it and make sure the door has not been bent as well. Test it, if it works, you're done. If not, next question.\nFaulty Door Hinges\nSometimes the door hinges may have been damaged or gone out of alignment. This is a frequent cause of problems with top-loading machines,\nCheck to see if the hinges are loose, or corroded (especially top loaders)\nCheck to see if they have been bent.  This will be apparent because the catch won't be aligned well with the latch mechanism hole.\nFaulty Latch Mechanism\nNow that your machine is opened, we have to consider what caused the problem.  You have either checked or don't have a handle that moves the door catch.  There are several failures that can occur. The latch mechanism is the most common culprit after the handle mechanism and catch.\nIs the latch faulty? Some of the signs might include:\nThe machine refuses to lock properly.\nThe machine shows DL codes.\nThe machine takes longer than usual to unlock, and may on occasion fail to do so.\nThe mechanism may hum or buzz and fail to release.\nHas the latch been damaged?\nTrying to open the door before the latch has released can damage the latch and make it jam.\nSlamming the door very hard can damage the latch mechanism as well.\nReplacing the latch mechanism is relatively simple and straightforward, usually involving two or three screws and a couple of wire connectors. It is usually the failed part at this point, so it is worth replacing.\nIf this does not solve the problem, go to the next step.\nFaulty Water Level Sensor\nIf the water level sensor is faulty, the machine may think it is still filled with water, and since the door is supposed to remain locked when that is the case, it won't open.\nSometimes the sensor itself may have failed.\nMore commonly it is the tube that runs from the washing machine drum to the sensor that has become plugged, possibly with lint, minerals, or other foreign materials. This tube fills with water which compresses the air trapped inside it and causes a diaphragm to operate a device to indicate the water level is correct. Some just directly read pressure and indicate the reading to the control board.\nYou can disconnect the tube from the water level switch to test it.\nTry running water through it with a small funnel. if it flows quickly through the tube, it's clear.\nAlternatively try\nblowing\nthrough the tube.\nBe sure not to suck on it\n, if there is trapped water in the tube (a common problem) you will get a mouthful.\nMany washers use a simple switch, possibly with multiple positions.  Check the switch for continuity and or operation.\nNote: on some newer models (LG for example) the switch may show variable frequency rather than continuity. This is best tested in test mode on your washer, and this switch is generally very reliable.\nFaulty Control Board\nSome machines have failures associated with their control boards that result in a clothing prison.  Some relays stick and refuse to trigger the latch release. This failure is both less common and more costly to fix.  If you have reached this point, the control board is likely the sole remaining culprit.\n2其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n2条评论\nغسالتي من نوع l g ذات فتحة امامية وقد توقفت فجأة عن العمل وظهر على شاشة المفاتيح الرمز ae مع بقاء الباب مقفل\nM Mr\n-\nاغفر هذا من مترجم جوجل! لديك غسالة lg تحميل امامي. حاول فصل الجهاز لعدة دقائق. من المفترض أن يشير الرمز إلى تسرب المياه. وأن الآلة تغلق نفسها.\nBill Gilbert\n-"

Bosch Home Appliances was founded by German engineer Robert Bosch in 1886. Bosch’s main operating areas include mobility (hardware and software), consumer goods (household appliances and power tools), industrial technology (drive and control), and energy and building technology.\nBosch developed its first home appliance, a home refrigeration unit, in 1933. In 1958, Bosch’s home division introduced the first Bosch washing machine, and the first full-service Bosch washing machines were released in 1960.  Bosch’s first washer/dryer combination appliance was produced in 1967. In the 21st century, Bosh washing machines included thermostat-controlled heating to kill 99.9 percent of common bacteria. Other Bosch washing machines include options to reduce energy consumption.\nWashing machines (also called laundry machines, clothes washers, or washers) are home appliances used to wash laundry using water. Users add laundry detergent in either liquid or powder form to the wash water and the machine uses agitation to clean laundry.   The first English patent for a washing machine was issued in 1691. Washing machines of this era were generally rotating drum washers, meaning they used enclosed containers or bases that had grooves, fingers, or paddles to help agitate laundry. Modern washing machines use direct drive motors where motor speed can be controlled electronically.\nAdditional Information\nWikipedia: Robert Bosch BmbH\nWikipedia: Washing Machine\nThe History of Bosch Washing Machines\n7其他贡献者\nTobias Isakeit\nTobias Isakeit - Repairability Engineer\nTobias Isakeit - Repairability Engineer\nBusiness"

They have a rich history dating back to 1919. Initially, the company focused on producing vacuum cleaners, but has since expanded its product catalog to include other household appliances. Today, Electrolux is one of the largest appliance manufacturers in the world, with operations in over 150 countries.\nThroughout its history, Electrolux has been at the forefront of technological innovation in the appliance industry. The company's success can be largely be attributed to its ability to leverage and develop technological advancements to adapt to changing consumer needs. One of the most significant innovations in Electrolux's history was the introduction of the first household refrigerator in 1925. This product was a game-changer for consumers who had previously to relied on iceboxes to keep their food cold.\nFollowing their successful introduction to the market in the 1950s with a manually operated top-loading washing machine they have continued to improve their washing machine technology. One of the company's most significant innovations was the introduction of the first front-loading washing machine in 1958. This design was more efficient than top-loading machines, using less water and detergent.\nMany of their more current models offer features such as steam cleaning and smart technology. The company's focus on innovation and customer needs has helped it maintain its position as a leader in the appliance industry.\nCommon Models:\nEFLS627UTT\nEFLS527UTT\nEFLW317TIW\nIdentification\nFront and Top: The model number can be found when the door is open, on the panel surrounding the drum.\nAdditional Information\nElectrolux Customer Support Line:\n1-877-435-3287\n2其他贡献者\nMatt Perona\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff"

The company began by importing and distributing household appliances but soon moved into manufacturing and designing its products. Fisher & Paykel quickly became known for producing high-quality appliances with innovative designs and features.\nIn the realm of washing machine technology the company introduced the SmartDrive washing machine in 1991, which used a direct drive motor instead of a traditional belt-driven system. This innovation made the machine more reliable and quieter, while also reducing the amount of water and energy needed for each wash cycle. They also developed the AquaSmart technology, which uses a low amount of water and gentle wash action to reduce fabric wear and tear. The Eco-Active wash system further reduces the amount of water and energy used during a wash cycle. They also developed the QuickSmart technology, which speeds up the washing cycle without compromising cleaning performance.\nCommon Models:\nWH2424F1 (Front Loader)\nWH2424P1 (Front Loader)\nWA3927G1 (Top Loader)\nIdentification\nTop: The model number is located behind the display board on the left side.\nFront: The model number can be found when the door is open on the inside of the door or above the door.\nAdditional Information\nFisher and Paykel Customer Support Line:\n1-888-936-7872\n2其他贡献者\nMatt Perona\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff"

    "title": "Fisher and Paykel Aquasmart Washing Machine Suspension Rods Replacement - iFixit 维修指南",
    "content": "Fisher and Paykel Aquasmart Washing Machine Suspension Rods Replacement\n简介\nMy washing machine was about 6 years old which appears to be about the age the suspension rods fail. The rods are full of oil which eventually leaks out. Additionally there are rubber straps which connect the rods to the drum chassis which stretch over time. It is worth replacing both at the same time. Surprisingly, this is a relatively easy fix and will save you big dollars doing it yourself. Check that you don't have a soap scum build up on the drum before commencing this repair first. You can look down the detergent cap recess after removing the cover to inspect the outside of the drum. I didn't have any so I went ahead and changed the rods and rubber hangers.\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\nGetting Started\nFirst step is to disconnect power.\nThen disconnect all the hoses at the back and move the machine to a place where you have some room to work.\n步骤 2\nRemove the Iid\nRemoving the lid is the easiest part. Just push back until the lid is perpendicular with the top of the machine, then lift upwards and it will release.\n步骤 3\nUnfasten the plastic cover\nSimply pry off the plastic screw covers then unscrew the two forward screws. Note there is no need to remove the cover, just tilt it backwards on its hinge to gain access. Be careful with hoses and electrical wires at the back of the cover.\n步骤 4\nSuspend the cover out of the way\nI used an old coat hanger to suspend the plastic cover out of the way by hooking it onto the trolley that I used to move the washing machine. This gives you access to the 4 rubber straps and 4 suspension rods.\n1条评论\n步骤 5\nReplace the Rubber Hanger Straps\nYou will see there are four rubber straps, one in each corner. I decided to replace these as well just to be on the safe side. When the old and new rubber straps were placed next to each other there was a significant difference in length. Just pull them straight off.\n步骤 6\nRemoving the Suspension Rod\nThe metal cylinder down the end is full of oil which leaks out over time. When I removed this one it was very greasy. Note: Im not sure if it was a defect or not, but my rear right rod appeared to have a bend in it and was unique to the other three.\n1条评论\n步骤 7\nLift out the Suspension Rods\nPlace your left hand under the drum rim and support it. Remove and replace one rod at a time. You don't want the weight of the drum on the motor and pump below as you may break something underneath. By replacing them one at a time, the other three can help support the weight of the drum.\n步骤 8\nRemoving the Suspension Rods\nTo remove the rods lift the plastic hanger off the chassis and then jiggle the bottom part of the rod out of the slotted holder. There are no fasteners holding the rods in place. Its just the weight of the drum holding them in place.\n步骤 9\nThe Rear Right Rod is Different to the Others\nThere is a clip half way down the rear right rod that needs to be undone. You also need to move the hoses and electrical looms out from under the plastic hanger prior to removing the rod. To remove the rods lift the plastic hanger off the chassis and then jiggle the bottom part of the rod out of the slotted holder.\n2条评论\n步骤 10\nReassembly\nOnce you have replaced all of the suspension rods and rubber straps you can reassemble the washing machine cover and lid.

Was it going out of balance in rinse and spin or were you getting codes. I have this issue, it goes badly out of balance on the rinse and spin cycles. The Tech that came out (under warranty) thinks it is the electronic module or motor. He is ordering both parts. I think it is the rods and rubber straps as we don't get any codes just the washer trying to walk out of the room! Nice guide by the way.\njmckillop\n-\nHi JMC,\nUnfortunately, being amateurs I guess we are always having to gamble when we take the plunge and buy parts. From my research the warn out rods is a common issue. Overtime they lose the oil out of the cylinders. If it's possible to get your fingers down at the base of the rods you might find that they are leaking oil which causes the problem.  However if your washing machine is under warranty I'm guessing its newish. This problem seems to occur as they get older, possibly over 5 years.  To answer your question, the problem I had was that it was going out of balance during rinse and spin and then just stopping, whilst making beeping noises and lights etc. the shaking was extremely violent.  Hope this helps. Anymore questions don't hesitate to ask.\nJames\n-\nJames,\njmckillop\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-35994\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/35994/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-35994\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/35994\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

Originally a merger between two electric companies it has since grown to become one of the largest companies in the world, with products ranging from aviation and energy to healthcare and home appliances. GE's success, in many ways, can be attributed to its pursuit of innovation as well as their continued development of cutting-edge technologies.\nIn 1939, GE introduced the first top-loading washing machine with an agitator, which revolutionized the way people did laundry. GE has continued to innovate and introduce new features such as automatic water level controls, variable speed motors, and smart controls. In 1995, GE introduced the first front-loading washing machine in the United States, which was more energy-efficient while using less water than top-loading machines.\nGE also developed a range of smart washing machines that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. These machines offer features such as automatic detergent dispensing and the ability to download new wash cycles.\nIn recent years, GE has shifted its focus away from home appliances and sold its appliance division to Haier in 2016. However, the company's legacy in the washing machine industry and its innovative contributions continue to have a significant impact on the way people do laundry today.\nCommon Models:\nGTW335ASNWW (Top Loader)\nGTW840CPNDG (Top Loader)\nGFW850SPNRS (Front Loader)\nIdentification\nTop: The model number can be found under the lid, near the right hinge, or on the back of the control panel, or on the bottom left corner, or on the back, near the water inlets.\nFront: The model number can be found when the door is open, on the front-facing panel around the drum or on the outside of the machine on the right side on the lower front corner.\nAdditional Information\nGE Customer Support Line:\n1-800-432-2737\n3其他贡献者\nMatt Perona\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff"

If you can read the error code, you can likely go to the correct place and save a little time. Not an absolute certainty, but it's often helpful.\nThe Basics\nA super valuable resource is the mini manual that is usually tucked away inside your machine. If you can open the machine up, the manual is often in the control console or inside the main housing. Sometimes, you can find them on top-loaders on the left side of the housing by pushing the basket toward the front and to the right. You can often reach into the left corner of the machine and find the tech sheet. This is your best source for understanding the codes, as it is more specific to your machine. Some front loaders have them.\nOne bright spot: The codes grow in number, but in many instances, the meaning of a particular code stays the same.\nTop Loaders\nData for the top loaders is shown below with some noted distinctions. There aren’t attached pages for the older ones, so make sure you take a look at the information before skipping to the error code lists. We have attached top loader error code pages for 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2018.\nEarlier Top Loaders\nReading the codes is complicated by the fact that GE top loaders have a number of different ways of displaying error codes. The early Hydro Wave machines (Early 2000s) simply had an LED on the Motor/Inverter assembly, which blinked with pauses to indicate motor faults. Those codes are reproduced below)\nThese codes are for Hydro Wave machines(applies to some Profile models, too, with the same drive train). The flashes repeat every 6 seconds per GE service manuals:\n1 Flash – >25 sec for the tub to stop\n2 Flashes – Belt Slipping, Replace the belt, also clean the pulleys—unexplained oil shows up occasionally.\n3 Flashes – Software Problem. Clear it. If it returns, replace the motor\n4 Flashes – Mode Shifter Failure\n5 Flashes – Motor Problem—Clear it, but replace the motor if the code returns.\n6 Flashes – Motor Locked—Remove the belt and attempt to turn the large pulley both ways. If frozen, replace the mode shifter. If free, replace the motor.\n7 Flashes – 4 wash cycles without the lid switch being opened. This points to a bad lid switch. Test the lid switch for function; it may have failed in the closed position.\n8 Flashes – Overheated Motor—Check as in 6 Flash case.\n9 Flashes – Brake Resistor Failed—Clear and test. Replace motor if code returns\n10 flashes – On units built after 2010, No communication between the Motor and Timer/Control board. Usually, the timer or Control board is the problem.\nLater GE Top Loaders (2006-2009)\nExample model numbers: WCRE6270K, WHRE5550K, WJRE5500K, WJRE5550K, WKRE5550K, WPRE6150K, WPRE8150K, WPRE6100, WPRE8100\nThese machines use a different system combining the motor codes above and an LED display. It also has you step through the possible error codes rather than displaying them. There is also a bit of self-testing functionality.\nTo retrieve error codes:\nPress and HOLD the Start/Pause Button\nRotate the Control Knob 180 degrees (8 bumps)\nIt may be helpful to set the control knob to a specific spot each time because that spot becomes a reference location for counting detents or stops later; no specific spot is necessary, though.\nRelease the Start/Pause Button\nAll LEDs should light.\nConsult\nthis document\nfor the meaning of each position of the knob\nNewer GE Top Loaders (2011-)\nNewer GE top loaders give you pretty full diagnostic codes and a full battery of functional tests. On many of the tests, if the machine fails the test, it will not go any further, and you will have to clear the error code again. So once you know the code, you should then use the test merely to verify it and start repairing it.\nError Code Lists\nGE 31 9188 Top Loader Error Codes And Diagnostics PP35 39 (2009)\nLink to PDF of Code Sheet (GE 31-9188 Ge Top Loader Error Codes and Diagnostics PP35-39 (2009) Same as 31-9145 (10/2006) Models: WPRE6100 WPRE8100 WCRE6270K WHRE5550K WJRE5500K WJRE5550K WKRE5550K WPRE6150K WPRE8150K\n31 16852 Yr 2012 GE Top Load DD Washer Mini Service Manual\nModels: GTWS8650DWS/8655DMC GTWN8450DWS/8455DMC GHWN8350DWS/8355DMC GTWN8250DWS/8255DMC GTWN8150DWS/8155DMC GTWN7450DWW\n2016 GE Washer Error Codes Binary 7Seg Doc. 31 9254\nModels: HTW200ASK_WW MTW200AMK_WW GTW220ACK_WW HTW240ASK_WW GTW330ASK_WW GTW460ASJ_WW GTW485ASJ_WW GTW485ASJ_WS GTW490ACJ_WW GTW490ACJ_WS GTW680BSJ_WS\n31 9281 GE GTW 750 2018 Top Load Error Codes\nOther GE Top Loaders using a Direct Drive Motor will have fault codes that are very similar to the front loader fault codes.\nFront Loaders\nA number of different codes are used depending on the age of your machine.

You can\naccess error code mode on your GE front load washer\nby pressing and holding the start pause button for 10 seconds until the screen lights up.

Here are some possible causes and solutions to get you going round and round again.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外一个贡献者)\nOn this page, we will look at GE top-load washing machines that are having trouble spinning. These machines are mainly belt-driven, with a few high-end models using a direct drive system. Belt failures are common with these washers. They generally can display error or diagnostic codes and self-test data, varying from unit to unit. Later units have more capabilities in this regard.\nThe Basics\nLoad Balance\nThe first step before you do anything else is to adjust the load. On some top loaders, the spin light will blink to indicate an out-of-balance condition. There may also be error codes 26 or 31 on some top loaders.\nCheck to see if the load has bunched. This can be common with a mixed load with a fitted sheet among the items. The sheet becomes like a sack, and the rest of the load ends inside it in a huge ball).  This can happen with flat sheets, too.\nAlso, washing a single large item can lead to this condition. Try to wash items that can be adjusted to balance each other.\nRearrange the items to be more evenly distributed.\nAn overloaded machine can also suffer from a no-spin condition. Overloading can increase belt slip, which will generate error codes. If the machine is very full, try removing some items.\nStart the cycle again and observe if the problem recurs. If the machine doesn’t turn, go to\nGE Top Load Washing Machine Not Spinning\nbelow.\nIf no problem, you are done!\nLeveling\nMake sure your washing machine is level. This can cause out-of-balance conditions, which will translate into unfinished spin cycles. Level both front to back and side to side. In some cases, the top may be uneven in profile, and you may need to use the edges of the cabinet where the top joins the sides. Make sure your machine doesn’t rock in any direction. If you just moved your machine to a different location, be sure to re-level it.\nRead the Error Codes\nYou will find information for reading the\nGE Washing Machine Error Codes on this page\n. Some earlier machines will have very limited information, mainly about the motor (GE traditional type and Hydra Wave Type), while newer top loaders will have much more information available and the ability to run sequenced self-tests.\nTriage\nAnswering a few questions can help you to check the most likely cause first.\nWill it spin in other cycles but not complete a cycle?\nGo to the GE tech sheet link below about the air dome repair possibly needed\nHL01 17 GTW HTW MTW No Spin Agitate Or Drain 1\nGo to\nDrain Pump Failure\nDoes it stop in the middle of a spin repeatedly?\nMake sure you check\nLeveling\nand\nLoad Balance\nimmediately above if you skipped it.\nGo to\nSuspension Problems\n.\nWill it not agitate as well as not spin?\nGo to\nDrive Belt Problems\n.\nGo to\nLid Switch and Latch Failure\n.\nWill it repeatedly not enter fast spin?\nGo to\nSuspension Problems\n.\nGo to\nPressure Wwitch/Water Level Control System Failure\n.\nGo to\nDrain Pump Failure\nGo to\nMotor Failure\nLid Switch and Latch Failure\nKeep in mind that a failure here may also cause a refusal to run a wash cycle as well. Sometimes, you may get a machine to run by closing the lid more forcefully.\nTop load units with just a flat plate on the top of the machine below the lid (no hole for a strike to go into) have a magnetic lid switch, and forceful closure will not do much except potentially dislodge the magnet.\nUse another magnet to see if the switch can be made to operate.\nIf the switch operates with the other magnet:\nCheck if the magnet on the lid has failed (still there) or come off.\nIf the magnet is still present,\nreplace the switch\nand magnet, as you can’t easily determine which of the two is the cause.\nIf it checks ok, go on to the next item.\nDrive Belt Problems\nThe next step is to\ncheck the drive belt\n. This will also give you insight into the drive mechanism of your washing machine. It may not have a drive belt!\nSeveral GE top-load machines, usually the top-of-the-line units, don’t have belts. Instead, they have a pancake-shaped motor on the bottom of the outer wash tub that drives the agitator or wash plate and basket directly. If you have one of these, skip to the next cause.\nTake a look at your belt.\nYou can check by tipping the machine back toward the wall,\nProp it up securely.\nCheck underneath and look carefully at the drive belt and the pulleys\nIs there oil or grease on the belt or pulleys? This is most common on top-load machines. Go to Oily or Greasy Belt.\nIs the belt frayed, cracked, or worn?\nIs the belt broken?\nMost GE top-load washers also allow you to access components by removing the front panel. Two clips are located in the seam area between the front panel and the top panel.\nUse a putty knife (or a butter knife) to locate and then push back on two clips that hold the front panel to the top panel.\nFrom the front of the machine,  push against each clip in turn toward the rear of the machine. It should release the front panel.\nOnce both clips are released, the top of the panel can be tilted forward, and then the bottom can be removed from two tabs on the machine frame.\nThis will give you basic access to the machine for reading codes on the motor/inverter on those models that have such.\nWhen belts slip, they get damaged in specific spots, leading to breakage. Oil and grease are especially harmful to belts in this regard.\nOily or Greasy Belt\nIf you discover oil or grease on the belt or pulleys of traditional type top load machines, it usually has leaked from the transmission. This is a sign that the seals on the transmission have failed. You can try just cleaning things up and replacing the belt. You will need to be prepared for the same failure again.  The real solution is a new or rebuilt transmission.\nOn machines with the belt guard, sometimes this oil or grease is just “there,” and there is no apparent leak from the gearcase. On these machines, if you find a failed drive belt, check the machine carefully for damage. The belt may have flailed around and damaged other components.  The speed sensor on the motor can be hit, as well as other nearby wiring, such as that for the mode shifter.\nTo clean an oily belt condition:\nRemove the belt.\nClean the pulleys thoroughly, preferably with paper towels and rubbing alcohol.\nDon’t try to clean or reuse the belt; replace it.\nHydro Wave machines have a very large pulley driven by a very small motor pulley, which can easily burn the belt if any part of the drive gets stuck. The tension on the belt is fairly high.\nSuspension Problems\nSuspension problems will cause the washer not to spin or not finish spinning, often with a repeated out-of-balance condition.\nSuspension rods on both kinds (traditional type and newer models) can get old and worn out and lose their ability to damp the motion of the tub.\nA quick check for the condition of your Suspension Rods is to push down on the washer basket/tub once, firmly, then release it quickly.\nIt should spring back into position and not bounce repeatedly; one bounce is ok to return to position. If it bounces more than that, the suspension rods must be replaced.\nThis will likely be the cause of the machine refusing to finish a spin cycle.\nAnother quick check for a failed rod is to check to see if the tub/basket is off-center when the machine is empty and stopped. An out-of-level condition could cause this, so this presumes you have checked that your machine is level. Remember, if one rod has failed, you should replace them all. If the rods are ok, move to the next item.\nMode Shifter Failure\nIf the Mode shifter fails, the machine will be unable to spin, meaning the shifter can’t engage to allow the basket to spin, or you may find that there is a grinding noise when the machine tries to spin. Frequently, the machine will reach the spin cycle and fail to engage, which will result in an error code. (Usually code 5) If the mode shifter looks corroded or you get that code along with the symptoms described above,\nreplace it\n. Otherwise, move on to the next step.\nPressure Switch/Water Level Control System Failure\nIf your machine thinks it still has water in it, it may refuse to spin. The Pressure Switch, or Sensor, functions as the water level control on both Hydra Wave and T-Type. Some of these controls are mounted directly on the control board, which is expensive if you need to replace the board. On Front loaders, a pressure sensor is a more common item, rather than a switch, and the usual resistance is around 20-23Ω.\nNewer machines usually give error codes if there is a problem with the sensor or the water level system. Among the numeric codes you might encounter are 6, 7, 8, 12, 18, 20, and 25 (pressure sensor dropout)\nIf the sensor can be checked in a diagnostic mode on the machine, do so.\nIf the sensor is a switch (common on older models), you can check it with a multimeter.\nFirst, blow into the switch. It should be possible to hear the switch click. If it doesn’t click, it might be a sensor rather than a switch.\nSet the multimeter to a continuity or Resistance setting, If it shows something around 20Ω, it is likely a sensor. If you get around 1Ω or less, it is a switch.\nCheck the switch operation with the multimeter connected. You may need a helper to hold the multimeter probes against the switch connections.\nYou should be able to blow into it and cause the switch to open and close, and the multimeter will confirm this.\nRemember that this is not a foolproof test; it will only show you that the switch contacts can function. It may be defective such that the rise in pressure in trapped air will not operate the switch.\nIf the sensor is OK, go on to the next item. If not, replace it.\nPressure Tube Clog\nOn many machines, the sensor is connected by a piece of flexible tubing (the Pressure Tube) to the tub or drum, and blowing through it is sufficient to blow out clogs. Occasionally, a no-drain condition can be caused by a clogged pressure tube. The machine will fill with water but fails because the clogged pressure tube holds in the pressure and makes the machine “think” it is still full, even when the pump has pumped it out. Numeric error code 21 can be associated with a permanent blockage if you don’t have codes 6,7, or 12 as well.\nDisconnect the pressure tube from the pressure sensor/switch\nBlow through it to see if it is clogged. Blow strongly through the tube. You may hear a little gurgling, and there may be a bit of resistance, but you usually can dislodge a clog this way.\nYou can also try to clean it using a vinegar solution. Use a small funnel and pour the solution through the tube into the washer drum or tub. If it won’t flow, this is a strong sign of a clog issue. Replace the tube and check the air dome for clogs. The vinegar does not harm your machine and may even make it smell better.\nIf the tube checks out, go to the next item.\nDrain Pump Failure\nThere is an outside chance that your drain pump is failing or is clogged. This is a good thing to check if you have found that the machine is leaving the clothes rather wet. Many machines will not enter the high spin mode if they aren’t completely empty, or they may give a long drain code and stop.\nDisconnect the hose from the tub to the pump and check for blockage.\nRemove the drain pump and check that it spins freely.\nCheck the tech sheet with your machine, if possible, for the resistance of the Drain pump winding. Use a multimeter to check it.\nIf it checks ok (usually 15-40Ω), move on to the next step.\nMotor Speed Sensor Failure\nThis is found on some later-model GE units mounted on the drive motor. These are the ones with the belt guard underneath. The symptoms will include an\ninability to complete a spin cycle or a wash cycle\n. There isn’t a specific test for it; rather, the symptoms will be a willingness to start the cycle and then shut down after a very short while. These symptoms are so characteristic of the speed sensor that it is worth just replacing the part.\nTo access the sensor:\nRemove the belt guard,\nRemove the drive belt\nDisconnect the motor wiring\nRemove the motor\nRemove the pulley\nThe speed sensor is clipped to the motor immediately under the edge of the pulley. Unclip it and replace it.\nReassemble and test the machine. If it completes cycles, you are done!\nOther Causes\nFuse Harness\nEarly Hydra Wave, 2010 and earlier (usually Green LED on the Motor) Can be checked as a fuse in the neutral side of the circuit. Check the continuity between the wire on the connector on the motor and the neutral terminal of the plug. If it tests ok or your machine isn’t a Hydra Wave, go on to the next item.\nMotor Capacitor\nLocated on the back panel of the control on T-type units (Traditional machines) Not a frequent failure, but an easy check. Use a multimeter to check the capacitor. If it shows continuity followed by increasing resistance, it is probably good. An open circuit, or a steady resistance near zero, shows a bad capacitor. Replace it. If it tests good, go to the next item.\nMotor Failure\nThe motor on your machine may have failed or partially failed so that it can’t go into full-speed spin mode. The bearings may have failed, causing the motor to become overloaded. You may find that the motor is very hot to the touch or will restart after it has time to cool. If a winding has failed, generally, the motor will struggle even to start. You can find values for checking the resistance of the motor windings in the mini manual for your machine. This is a fairly major repair, and if your machine is older, it may not be economical to attempt. If the motor is ok, move on to the next item.\nMain Control Board\nAt this point, the main control board is the remaining item to check. Several error codes may lead you straight to it. This, too, is a costly part, but the replacement is less involved than replacing the motor, so that it may be worth the attempt. You may be able to get a main control board from a broken or discarded machine as well.\n1其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

Due to the multiplicity of models and features only a general overview is possible.\nFirst Steps\nThese machines are belt driven with the motor mounted on the drum.   They have electronic controls from early on.  They generally are capable of displaying error or diagnostic codes and self-test data which can vary from unit to unit.\nLoad Balance\nThe first step before you do anything else is to adjust the load. This is the most common reason for a no-spin condition.  Front-loaders use sensing cycles to determine the load size, and if they can’t get the load to distribute evenly, which they attempt to do by back-and-forth partial rotations, they won’t spin.\nCheck to see if the load has bunched. This can be common with a mixed load with a fitted sheet among the items. The sheet becomes like a sack and the rest of the load ends up inside of it in a huge ball).  This can happen with flat sheets too.\nAlso, washing a single large item can lead to this condition. Try to wash items that can be adjusted to balance each other.\nRearrange the items to be more evenly distributed.\nAn overloaded machine can also suffer from a no-spin condition. Overloading can increase belt slip which will generate error codes. If the machine is very full, try removing some items.\nStart the cycle again and observe if the problem recurs. If the machine won’t turn, go to Drive Belt Problems below\nIf no problem, you are done!\nLeveling\nMake sure your washing machine is level. This can cause out-of-balance conditions, which will translate into unfinished spin cycles. Level both front to back and side to side. In some cases, the top may be uneven in profile, and you may need to use the edges of the cabinet where the top joins the sides. Make sure your machine doesn’t rock or wobble in any direction. If you just moved your machine to a different location, be sure to re-level it.\nRead the Error Codes\nYou will find information for reading the\nGE Washing Machine Error Codes on this page\n. Many front-load machines have substantial diagnostic information available as well as the ability to run sequenced self-tests.\nTriage\nWill it spin in other cycles but not complete a cycle?\nGo to Drain Pump Failure\n.\nDoes it stop in the middle of a spin repeatedly?\nMake sure you check\nLeveling\nand\nLoad Balance\nGo to\nSuspension Problems\nGo to\nMotor Failure\nWill it repeatedly not enter fast spin?\nMake sure you check\nLeveling\nand\nLoad Balance\nGo to\nDrive Belt Problems\nGo to\nSuspension Problems\nGo to\nPressure Switch/Water Level Control System Failure\nGo to\nDrain Pump Failure\nGo to\nMotor Failure\nDoor Switch or Latch Failure\nKeep in mind that a failure here may also cause a refusal to run a wash cycle as well. Sometimes, you may get a machine to run by closing the door more forcefully.\nDoor Switch Failure\nFailure of the door switch is a common cause of no spin conditions. Test it for continuity if possible. You may be able to do so at the main control board if you have access to a schematic diagram that shows what wires to check. If you can check the switch this way, trace the wires if possible.\nYou should trace these from the switch as there is an outside chance that a wire has broken or been cut.\nSome machines will have a connector at the switch, making it possible to test it directly with a multimeter.\nRemove the switch for easier testing in this case.\nDoor Latch Failure\nDoor latch failure will prevent agitation or spin. The control board on most of these units with electronic controls is looking for a signal from the lid latch that indicates engagement, along with the continuity check that indicates that the lid is closed. Testing the signal is beyond the scope of this wiki, so if you have symptoms that include a failure to lock,\nreplace the latch/switch first\n. If the problem persists, replace the main control board.\nDrive Belt Problems\nA broken belt is a frequent cause of a no spin condition, and the machine will not wash either. The next step is to check the drive belt. This will mean moving the machine away from the wall to access the rear access panel.\nA quick test is to see if the drum spins with little or no effort.  This is a likely sign of a broken belt, so you should check further.\n. Check the following:\nThe belt may just be worn out and slipping.\nCheck to see if the belt has oil or grease on it. This isn’t as common on front loaders.\nCheck if any part is rubbing on the belt, etc.\nCheck to see that the pulleys are tight.\nCheck that the motor mounting fasteners are tight.\nSuspension Problems\nSuspension problems will cause the washer to not spin or not finish spinning, often with a repeated out of balance condition.\nShocks or Springs can fail and make your machine suffer from unbalanced load failures.You can try the bounce test, but it is harder to observe and harder to bounce the drum in a way that tests all of the shocks. Your best bet for checking is to look at the shocks themselves, To do this you will need to gain access to the lower part of your machine. This will likely involve removing both front and rear access panels.\nOnce you have access to the shock absorbers or dampers, check to see if they are leaking.\nThis is best done with a paper towel. Use it to wipe the shiny shaft on the shock. Check for oil leakage.\nIf you see one with a potential leak your best bet is to remove it so you can check for smooth resistance through the whole length of travel.\nYou want to compress the shock, and then extend it noting if there are loose or very stiff spots.\nIf any shocks fail this test replace all of them, as likely another one will fail after the first failed one is replaced.\nIf your suspension systems seem to be ok, go on to the next item that applies.\nPressure Switch/Water Level Control System Failure\nIf your machine thinks it still has water in it it may refuse to spin. The Pressure Switch or Sensor, functions as the water level control. You will find one of two types of sensing devices, a pressure switch (usually with multiple switching stages), or a pressure sensor. You can normally tell what type your machine has by the connectors. The pressure sensor has one three-wire connector, while the pressure switch has two connectors with two or three wires each.Pressure sensors are more common on later (2016+) high end units; the usual resistance is around 20Ω. The sensing device is connected by a flexible tube to the drum or tub.\nNewer machines usually will give error codes if there is a problem with the sensor/switch or the water level system.\nIf the sensor can be checked in a diagnostic mode on the machine, do so. The GE Washing Machine Error Codes page has information on running these tests.\nIf the sensor is a switch (common on older models) you can check it with a multimeter.\nFirst, blow into the switch. It should be possible to hear the switch click. If it doesn’t click it might be a sensor rather than a switch.\nSet the multimeter to a continuity or Resistance setting, If it shows something around 20Ω it is likely a sensor. If you get around 1Ω or less it is a switch\nCheck the switch operation with the multimeter connected. You may need a helper to hold the multimeter probes against the switch connections.\nYou should be able to blow into it and cause the switch to open and close, and the multimeter will confirm this.\nRemember that this is not a foolproof test; it will only show you that the switch contacts can function. It may be defective such that the rise in pressure in trapped air will not operate the switch.\nIf the sensor is OK, go on to the next item. if not replace it.\nPressure Tube Clog\nThe piece of flexible tubing (the Pressure Tube) to the tub or drum can get clogged, and blowing through it is usually sufficient to blow out clogs. Occasionally a no drain condition can be caused by a clogged pressure tube. The machine will fill with water, but fails because the clogged pressure tube holds in the pressure and makes the machine “think” it is still full, even when the pump has pumped it out.\nDisconnect the pressure tube from the pressure sensor/switch\nBlow through it to see if it is clogged. Blow strongly through the tube. you may hear a little gurgling and there may be a bit of resistance, but you usually can dislodge a clog this way.\nYou can also try to clean it using a vinegar solution. Use a small funnel and pour the solution through the tube into the washer drum or tub. If it won’t flow, this is a strong sign of a clog issue. Replace the tube and check the air dome for clogs. The vinegar is not harmful to your machine and may even make it smell better.\nIf the tube checks out, go to the next item.\nDrain Pump Failure\nThere is an outside chance that your drain pump is failing, or is clogged. This is a good thing to check if you have found that the machine is leaving the clothes rather wet. Many machines will not enter the high spin mode if they aren’t completely empty, or they may give a long drain code and stop.\nDisconnect the hose from the tub to the pump and check for blockage.\nRemove the drain pump\nand check that it spins freely.\nCheck the tech sheet with your machine if possible for the resistance of the Drain pump winding. Use a multimeter to check it. Around 10-20 Ω is okay.\nMotor Failure\nThe motor on your machine may have failed or partially failed so that it can’t go into full-speed spin mode.

Four Screws.\n步骤 2\nThere is a plastic bag around the wire harness at the left edge of the opening.\nUntwist the wire wrap and open this \"bag\".\nRemove the pump wire from the wire clips along the bottom of the machine until the pump wire is free except where it connects to the pump and the wire bundle in the \"bag\".\nUnplug the pump wire connector.\nWith the machine completely drained of water remove the hoses from the drain pump. !!!BUT WOAH ANY WATER LEFT IN THE MACHINE WILL FLY OUT OF THESE HOSES!!! I encountered a few gallons but there can be much much more depending on how well the machine is drained.\n步骤 3\nRemove two screws from the pump mount. These are located on the side of the pump closest to the opening.\nRock the pump back away from you off of the screw holes and pull the pump free.\n步骤 4\nBring pump to a bench.\nLabel the terminals with a permanent marker indicating wire color.\nRemove the screws from the base and remove the base.\n步骤 5\nRemove the rear cover from the pump motor. (Notice it's a brushless motor, NICE! :) )\nLook at the side of the pump body and locate a latch. (image 2)\nCarefully lift the latch with a screwdriver and rotate the pump body clockwise. The pump body will come off.\n步骤 6\nThere is a clip at the top of the pump motor that can be undone with a flat screwdriver.\nThe motor coils and cover can then slide back leaving just the plastic motor body containing the magnetic spindle.\nThe plastic motor body has a large reservoir to collect any accumulated debris and keep it separated from the motor spindle.\nThis was packed with accumulated sand and interfered with the motor spindle.\n步骤 7\nThe pump is now fully disassembled. The non-electrical parts can be cleaned, specifically the motor body's dirt reservoirs.\nRepeatedly fill the motor body with water and flush out the collected sand. The plastic flange under the impeller can be lifted slightly allowing an easy path for the sand and water.\nClean the pump body.\n1条评论\n步骤 8\nReassemble the pump.\nPlace the motor coils back into the cover and slide them back onto the motor body.\nSlide the rear cover back onto the motor coils so the terminals are in position through the back of the cover.\n步骤 9\nReplace the o-ring on the pump. I used a small amount of petroleum jelly to lubricate and seal the o-ring.\nAlign and twist the pump body into position counter clockwise until the latch engages.\nReinstall the pump base with its two screws.\n步骤 10\nReplace the wires on the terminals according to the colors that were marked earlier.\nCongratulate the engineer who designed this repairable pump. It's good.\nReplace the umbrella. The pump is reassembled. You saved $150+.\n步骤 11\nReinstall the pump into the washing machine.\nHook the back edge of the pump into its mounts and rock it forward onto the mounting screw points.\nInstall the two mounting screws.\n步骤 12\nApply a thin layer of RTV to the hose fittings of the pump.\nAttach the wash drum hose to the hose fitting in the center of the pump. Align the hose clamp and make sure it's tight.\nAttach the laundry tub hose to the top hose fitting. Align the hose clamp and make sure it's tight.\n步骤 13\nRoute the pump wire back through the clips that are built into the floor of the washer.\nReconnect the pump wire plug.\nTuck the connectors back into the \"bag\" and secure the wire wrap.\n步骤 14\nReinstall the plastic pump umbrella, since it falls off in the installation process.\nReplace the back cover of the washer.\nAllow the RTV to cure for a few hours before testing the repair.\nGood luck!!! and always help the Grammas :)\n步骤 15\n[The following 2 steps were added as an optional addendum to step 6 by a different author]. It is possible that your pump may be suffering from the same problem as mine where the center chamber with the magnetic core has also gotten waterlogged. If the steps provided above did not fully resolve your issue and you really want to try and fix this pump yourself, You may need to take this to the next level.\nFirst, be sure the pump motor has not burned out. If the pump still works after a fashion, but just not sufficient to get the job done, then the motor is most likely still good.\nYou can take a multimeter, set it to read Ohms and place the multimeter probes on the 2 terminal leads on the back of the pump.  If you get a reading of zero, then the pump motor has burned out and must be replaced.\nIf the pump motor is still good but you are looking at needing to replace the pump anyways and you are handy, then you may wish you examine the magnetic core to see if there is water in the center chamber where the core resides.  Inside the pump case, there are 3 chambers, 2 on the sides and 1 in the center.\nThe 2 chambers on the sides are not water sealed and water and grit can get in and rot and really putrefy.  That is what all that black junk was that was coming out of the pump.\nThe center chamber is where the magnetic core resides and this needs to remain free from water and debris.  It needs to be lightly greased so the magnetic core spins freely. There is a rubber stopper on the top of the magnetic core which should keep the center chamber dry.\nIf the rubber stopper is warn, then water will get in and decrease the pump's efficiency.  To examine if this is your problem, you need to gently remove the magnetic core.\n步骤 16\nFor this discussion the core comprises of the following as one unit: rotary blade, lid, rubber seal, spindle and magnet. To remove the core, gently pry with a flat head screw driver all around the top edge and gently lift the core out of the case housing.\nThe location to pry is NOT directly under the rotary blade, but under the cover piece which resides directly BELOW the rotary blade. If you look at the picture for this step, you see the pump standing upright.\nGoing from top to bottom, first is the rotary blade, then below the rotary blade is the lid (which covers the pump case housing), then there is a small gap between the lid and the case housing and then the black o-ring and then the rest of the case housing. Gently pry in the small gap between the lid and the case housing to remove the core.\nThe core is only being held in place by the rubber stopper and the magnetic forces.  One advantage to removing the core, is that you will have full access to clean the junk out of the side chambers in the pump and it will be easier to clean out.\nHowever, if you do decide to do this step, you need to realize that you may compromise the integrity of the pump by introducing water and other foreign material into the center chamber. So, only do this step if you are prepared to replace your pump or are handy and able to refurbish it.\nOnce I removed the core from my pump, I could clearly see that the center chamber was also full of putrid water and I surmised that the rubber seal was warn out and no longer doing it’s job to keep the water out and I replaced my pump.\nI am not a mechanical engineer, but I guess if you wanted to try and refurbish the pump, you would have to fully clean and dry it, add new grease to the core, and apply some silicone sealant to the rubber stopper to try and re-seal the stopper when you put it back into the pump.\nThen let the sealant fully dry before re-installing the pump into the washer and testing it.\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n结论\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n9等其他人完成本指南。\n7其他贡献者\nsnaxxus\n撰写一个指南\n6指南评论\nI have the same problem.  Washer will not drain.  I removed the pump witch by the way is the same as yours and found some black sand by the o ring.  The impeller don't seem stuck but i will flush out the black sand and hope that works.\nalexoayala\n-\nAwesome. Thank you. This 45 yr old momma just rocked that broken washing machine! I did everything as directed but was not successful in washing out the dirt within the pump. I ordered a new pump for $89 on amazon prime. Still a winner!!! THANKS!\nbethmaillho\n-\nwhat if the propeller is pushed out toward the front if the housing?\njames woods\n-\nI noticed the center compartment had water in it when I shined a flashlight from the back.  I took the motor apart and cleaned out the 3 compartments.  I lubricated the magnet on the shaft and reinstalled it.  It appears that the round rubber seal on the center compartment was leaking from where the shaft exits the compartment and attaches to the propeller.  I just coated the magnet in the shaft and put some pet jelly behind the propeller.  I’m sure this will leak again and I will need to replace the entire motor.  The motor is pretty inexpensive at around $20 online and $38 from Sears parts store.\nLucky Mike\n-\nLucky Mike, It’s been about a year since you refurbished your pump. How long did it last? The brand new OEM authorized pump I purchased from Amazon only lasted 2 years, so I am thinking of just doing as you did at least as a stop-gap until a new pump arrives. Did the petroleum jelly do the trick or should I resort to a silicone sealant on the center rubber seal?\nMARK BROWN\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-21834\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/21834/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-21834\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/21834\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

They initially produced an electric iron that was popular in American households of the time. In 1918 they expanded production to include electric ranges, and by the 1920s, they had further expanded their catalog to include refrigerators and washing machines.\nIn the 1950s, Hotpoint introduced one of the first automatic washing machines, which had a top-loading design and featured a spin cycle to help dry clothes, which was a significant design improvement over current models of the time which required manual operation. By the 1960s they had also introduced a line of front-loading washing machines, which improved efficiency while using less water and detergent than their top-loading cousins. They also had an improved capacity that allowed consumers to do more washing with fewer loads.\nHotpoint continued to introduce new features, such as multiple wash cycle options, automatic temperature control, digital controls, and advanced sensors that could detect the size and weight of the load and adjust the wash cycle accordingly. Hotpoint as also introduced washing machines with features such as steam cleaning and smart technology.\nCommon Models:\nHTW240ASKWS\nHTX24EASKWS\nGTW335ASNWW\nIdentification\nLikely located in one of the following locations:\nTop:\nUnder lid, near the right hinge.\nExterior, on the back of the control panel.\nExterior, bottom left corner.\nExterior back, near the water inlets.\nFront:\nInside door panel, on the wash compartment face.\nExterior right side, lower front corner.\nAdditional Information\nHotpoint Customer Support Line:\n1-800-626-2005\n1其他贡献者\nMatt Perona\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff"

If you feel to the left in front of pump (Red Square) you can check water inlet from drum.\nIf you turn the machine on and start a spin and drain cycle with cover of you should see white plastic blades spinning. (Best not to stick your figure in to check!)\n步骤 3\nCheck Drain from drum to pump\nIf the drum is full of water (door lock stays engaged/water level visable) and pump is clear and running on drain cycle then blockage is most likely in rubber drain which connect drum to pump... (Circled in blue)\nNote: There is no way of removing this without draining the drum at the same time!\nIf you can see water level then there is at least a bucket's worth of water which you much not want to just tip on your floor...\nIf washing machine can easily be moved outside or to a wet room (remember it's heaver than normal because it's full of water & cloths!) then that's best options. Where ever you do this it will be much easier with machine either on it's side, lend left hand side on against a wall (45 degrees) or standing on bricks/blocks\nEither way, the machine needs to be stable (not at risk of falling on you, and ideally your are able to access the bottom of machine can get washing up bowl under where drain (circled in blue) connect to drum. Whilst it's technically possible remove rubber drain through rear of machine access cover, you will have not way to stop flood\nThe small (pump end) of rubber drain hose is attached with metal spring clip - squeese the to short thick metal wire ends and it should pull off of pump. Undoing this might release a bit more water, but blockage is probably above the ball at bottom of the drum.\nThe big end the connect to drum is a PH2 compression clasp - a PH2 screwdriver should fit directly behind the motor wiring to lose this. When this is loose the rubber should ease of of the plastic drum outer.\nNote this may release a lot of water!\n步骤 4\nChecking the Rubber drain hose\nOnce you've got rubber drain off other washing machine the source of blockage should be immediately obvious and easy to remove!\nAt the top of the rubber hose is a large ball which (I guess intentionally) stop anything but slimmest items passing any further.\nAfter you've remove obvious blockage you should be able to poor water though it...\nBefore you re-install, just check visually there is nothing else in bottom of the drum.\n步骤 5\nRegaining working machine\nAlways run  spin and drain cycle after re-assembling and monitor outflow to confirm water is being pump out (Note: If you ended up entirely draining the drum there might not be much but there should still be some)\nThen run a rinse and spin cycle as you don't know where in the wash cycle original error occurred. This will also fill drum and then drain it entirely which is good test pump is working properly.\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n结论\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n1其他贡献者\nP Badrick\n0指南评论\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-168802\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/168802/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-168802\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/168802\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

They sell most of their appliances at Sears, Kmart and Amazon. They are produced by several companies including Whirlpool, LG, Electrolux, Panasonic, Cleva North America and Daewoo Electronics.\nOriginally, the Kenmore brand washing machines were introduced by Whirlpool in 1947. They were an automatic spinner-type washing machine. Whirlpool continues to make Kenmore brand washers for Sears.\nThe Whirlpool Kenmore top-load machines had some specific features they created. One was called the “wig wag” mechanism. It was used for years until more modern features replaced it. The mechanism is an oscillating piece mounted next to two solenoids. They engage agitation or spin and the motor operates continuously. It was a reliable feature. Another feature was a mechanical fuse that breaks in overly loaded machines so the motor doesn’t break or get damaged.\nKenmore has an upmarket line called the Elite line as well as a professional line of washers called Kenmore Pro.\nGood Housekeeping rated the Kenmore Elite Top-Load Washer with Steam and Acela Wash the best value washing machine of 2020 in a May 2020 article.\nAdditional Information\nWikipedia:\nKenmore (brand)\nAmazon:\nKenmore Washers\nKenmore:\nKenmore Washers\nWikipedia:\nWashing Machines\n7其他贡献者\nSam Goldheart\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff"

Try these fixes to get your washing machine working, again!\nArielle Sampson\n(和另外一个贡献者)\nDoes your Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machine no longer spin or agitate laundry during wash cycles? Does your washing machine also make strange noises or click when you turn on the machine? Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machines are susceptible to a range of problems that could cause them to stop spinning or agitating. Check the following causes to identify and solve the problem.\nBroken Drive Belt\nIf the washer will not agitate, its drive belt may have worn out. Over time, the drive belt wears out due to normal use. The belt should be replaced every two to three years, depending on how much the washing machine is used. Use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Drive Belt Replacement Guide\nto replace the machine’s drive belt.\nFaulty Lid Switch\nIf you have replaced the washing machine’s lid switch and the machine is still not agitating laundry, it may have a faulty lid switch.  The lid switch assembly can fail either mechanically or electronically, making this a very common problem. Use an Ohmmeter to test any electrical switches near the lid switch for continuity. According to their design, the lid switch should have continuity. If your Ohmmeter does not show that the lid switch has continuity, use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Lid Switch Replacement Guide\nto replace the washing machine’s lid switch.\nFaulty Water Level Sensor\nIf the washing machine is not able to detect that the water level has reached the desired height, it will not agitate. Open the washing machine’s control panel and look for the water level valve. If the plastic tube attached to the valve appears clogged, use vinegar to unclog it. If the switch appears corroded, it may need to be replaced. Use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Water Level Sensor Replacement Guide\nto replace a faulty or corroded water level sensor.\nFaulty Motor Control Board\nIf the washing machine still does not agitate or spin, the motor control board may be defective. The motor control board is designed to provide power to the washing machine’s motor. If the motor control board is defective, the washing machine may not function at all. Use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Electronic Control Replacement Guide\nto replace the machine’s motor control board.\nFaulty Tub Motor\nIf the washing machine continues to not agitate or spin, its drive motor may be faulty. This is not a common problem and all other parts related to this problem should be investigated before replacing the motor. If the motor is visibly damaged, it will most likely need to be replaced.\nQuestions other people have asked about this\nWhy won't my washer spin or drain?\nWhy will my washing machine not agitate?\nLoud clicking during agitation cycle\nWasher won't spin or agitate\nRemoving the agitator assembly\nHow do I take out the agitator?

Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machines are susceptible to a range of problems that could prevent them from ceasing to spin when the lid is opened. Check the following causes to identify and solve the problem.\nFaulty Lid Switch\nIf your washing machine does not stop operating when you open the lid, the lid switch is likely faulty. Use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Lid Switch Replacement Guide\nto replace your washing machine’s faulty lid switch.\nFaulty Door or Lid Latch Assembly\nIf the washer’s lid or door won’t lock, the machine’s switch assembly might be defective. This is a very common problem as the lock and switch assembly can fail either mechanically or electrically. Test any electrical switches with an Ohmmeter for continuity. According to their design, the switches should have continuity. If there is no continuity in any of the electrical switches, the culprit wire will need to be replaced.\nFaulty Door Lock\nIf the washing machine’s door won’t latch, the door lock assembly may be faulty. The door lock assembly is generally made of plastic, so if it is broken, it will need to be replaced.\nFaulty Main Control Board\nIf the washing machine’s door refuses to unlock, the problem may be with the main control board. If you have tried the previous solutions and the problem persists, use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Electronic Control Replacement Guide\nto inspect and replace the main control board, if necessary.\nQuestions other people have asked about this\nHow to bypass lid switch\nThe top lid won't lock\nNo power after replacing lid switch\nThe door will lock and unlock about six times\nThe door lid locked and won't unlock\nWhy is my washer lid locked light flashing?\nRelated Pages\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Makes Unusual Noises\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Won’t Turn On\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Won’t Drain\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Doesn’t Spin Or Agitate\n1其他贡献者\nArielle Sampson\n撰写一个指南\n0条评论"

Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machines are susceptible to a range of problems that can cause them to stop turning on. Check the following causes to identify and solve the problem.\nTripped Circuit Breaker\nIf your washing machine will not turn on, it might have tripped the outlet’s circuit breaker. Find your circuit breaker and see if the washing machine’s circuit was tripped. If it was, flip the switch back to rest the circuit.\nThe Machine Needs To Be Reset\nIf you have reset the washing machine’s circuit breaker and the machine still does not work, the washing machine may simply need to be reset. Unplug the washing machine and leave it unplugged for at least five minutes. Then, plug in the washing machine and try to use it, again.\nFaulty Outlet\nIf you have tried the above solutions and the washing machine still does not turn on, it may be plugged into a faulty power outlet. Unplug the washing machine from its power outlet. Then, plug in something like a working lamp to the washing machine’s power outlet to check if the outlet is working properly. If the lamp does not turn on when plugged into the washer’s power outlet, try plugging the washing machine into another power outlet.\nQuestions other people have asked about this\nIt won't start or turn on\nKenmore 110 will not power on.\nWhy won't it power on\nRelated Pages\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Doesn’t Stop Spinning When Lid Is Opened\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Won’t Drain\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Doesn’t Spin or Agitate\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Makes Unusual Noises\n1其他贡献者\nArielle Sampson\n撰写一个指南\n1条评论\nsaddiebabielove\n-"

Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machines are susceptible to a range of problems that could cause them to stop draining. Check the following causes to identify and solve the problem.\nClogged Waste Hose\nIf your washing machine does not automatically drain the wastewater, the machine’s waste hose might be clogged. To unclog the waste hose, remove the hose from the back of the washing machine by unclipping it. Then, clear it out using running water and a toilet snake. After the hose is cleared, snap it back in place on the back of the washing machine and try to use the machine again.\nClogged Drain Pump\nIf your washing machine’s waste hose is cleared of any clogs and it is still not draining properly, your machine may have a faulty drain pump. Because the drain pump has a translucent cover, a clog may be visible in the pump without having to take it apart. If you see a clog, use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Water Pump Replacement Guide\nto remove the machine’s water pump.\nFaulty Lid Switch\nThe lid switch assembly prevents the washer from spinning when the lid is open. If the lid switch assembly fails, the washer will not drain. To determine if the lid switch assembly is defective, use a multimeter to test each of the lid switches for continuity. If a lid switch does not have continuity, use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Lid Switch Replacement Guide\nto replace the machine’s faulty lid switch.\nFaulty Pump Motor\nIf you have removed any clogs from the washing machine’s waste hose and drain pump and the machine still will not drain water, there might be a problem with the pump motor. The washing machine’s motor provides the drain pump with the power to drain the basin.  Find a replacement motor for your Kenmore washing machine from\nthis website\nand use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine transmission, motor, and pump diagram\nto replace the faulty motor.\nQuestions other people have asked about this\nWhy won't my washer spin or drain?\nKenmore washer water continues to fill overflows on all cycles\nWater on floor during wash/ drain cycle\nWhy is my drain pipe overflowing?\nCould the drain pump be clogged?\nWhy my washer is not emptying\nWasher doesn't drain completely\nOverflows when draining.

Try these fixes to get your washing machine working, again!\nArielle Sampson\n(和另外2个贡献者)\nDoes your Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machine make strange noises during use? Kenmore 110 Series Washing Machines are susceptible to a range of problems that can cause them to make strange or very loud noises. Check the following causes to identify and solve the problem.\nMissing Bolt\nSome users have reported a bolt falling out from the bottom of the machine. The bolt holds the washing machine’s main pulley on. Over time, the bolt can back itself out of the pulley’s assembly, causing the pulley to fall down and rub against its plastic cage. This can cause a ratcheting sound and a burning smell. Check underneath your washing machine for any loose bolts. Also, check to see if the machine’s drive pulley has fallen down and is rubbing against its plastic cage. If so, use a new bolt and spring washer to reattach the pulley belt.\nWorn Clutch Assembly\nIf your washer continues to make a loud noise during the spin cycle, the machine’s clutch assembly might be worn out. The clutch assembly makes the connection between the washing machine’s transmission and the inner tub. The clutch assembly allows the tub to gradually get up to the proper spin speed. As the clutch wears out with age, it may become noisy during the spin cycle or just after the spin cycle finishes. If the clutch is loud or not working properly, it will need to be replaced. Use the\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Transmission Clutch Replacement Guide\nto replace the machine’s clutch assembly.\nFaulty Tub Bearing System\nThe washing machine’s rear drum includes bearings in it to keep the inner tub spinning smoothly. If the tub bearing system is defective, the washer may become very noisy, especially on the spin cycles. On some washing machines, the bearings are sold separately from the rear drum. However, experts recommend replacing both the outer drum and the bearings as an assembly, if the manufacturer sells the components together. Removing and pressing in the new bearing can prove difficult, but replacing the outer tub and bearing together is slightly easier.\nQuestions other people have asked about this\n\"Ratcheting\" noise in wash cycle only\nWasher makes very loud noise during spin cycle\nLoud banging noise only during spin cycle\nWhy is my washer leaking and making noise?\nLoud banging during spin/out of balance\nLoud Noise During Spin Cycle\nWasher makes very loud noise during spin cycle\nLoud knocking noise and when the cycle completes\nKenmore type 110 washing machine buzzing noise\nGrinding Noise when turning even by hand.\nWhy is the washer making noise and jumping during the spin cycle?\nThere is a terrible thumping noise and vibration when in use.\nIt is making loud clicks and even a couple of bangs\nMy washer is making a bad noise\nWhy is my Kenmore washer making loud noise during spin cycle?\nWhy is my Kenmore Washer creating a load noise during the Spin cycle.\nKenmore Washer Spin cycle noise\nLoud chunk-a chunk-a sound during agitate cycle\nKenmore 110 washer howls during spin cycle\nNoisy operation duirng wash cycle\nWhy is my washer making a loud noise when it starts?\nRelated Pages\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Doesn’t Stop Spinning When Lid Is Opened\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Won’t Turn On\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Won’t Drain\nKenmore 110 Series Washing Machine Doesn’t Spin Or Agitate\n2其他贡献者\nArielle Sampson\n撰写一个指南\n0条评论"

Sears repair came out.  Mind you after we cancelled the appointment because the was rude and assisted I'm charging my credit card before the repairman even came out.  Anyways the repairman came out hooked his computer up to it and proclaimed the control board is bad and you can either buy a new one which would be over 500.00 dollars which includes labor.  Or buy the maintenance warranty for 200.00 which is good for one year.     The codes that were shown were F05 and E02.  So we told them nevermind.  Week later as we were shopping for a new washer.  We stumbled upon a video on a guy basically cleaned the little metal contact switch which causes the lid to lock and unlock.  It has two prongs that slide back and forth.  If it gets dirty or doesn't have a good contact to the circuit board it will cause this problem.  Low and behold it worked.  Here is the link to the video.\nhttps://youtu.be/nvFrFZYq-GA\nPaul\n-"

They have a capacity of 3.2cu ft,  which is equivalent to washing a load of several bath towels. Moreover, with its dual action agitator, the machine uses 28% less water and 40% less energy, compared to the normal cycle of a conventional machine built before 2004. The Kenmore 400 is only available in white and works well for small households.\nThe age of a Kenmore washer can be identified through its serial number, which can be found in several locations: back of the cabinet (near the top), or on the front of the machine, or the side of the machine’s base. Since the Kenmore 400 is a top load machine, more possible locations including under the lid, on the right rim of the washer tub, or along the control panel. Then, the beginning of the model numbers indicate which company the washer was manufactured by. Kenmore is a brand name used by Sears of its appliances. However, the washing machines are actually manufactured by Whirlpool or Frigidaire. Model numbers beginning with “110” belong to Whirlpool and those beginning with “417” belong to Frigidaire.\nFor washers made by Whirlpool, the second letter of the serial number identifies the year the machine was manufactured. For example, “L” means 2001, “M” means 2002, and so on through the letter “Y”, which means 2009.\nFor washers made by Frigidaire, the serial number begins with two letters, followed by several numbers. The first of the numbers represents the year of manufacture.  In recent models, the number “2” means 2002, “3” means 2003,  “4” means 2004, and so on. The following two numbers identify the week of the year the washer was built.\nAdditional Information\nSears Product Support\nIdentifying the Age of Kenmore Washers\n3其他贡献者\nSam Goldheart\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff"

    "content": "Kenmore 80 Series Washer Water Inlet Valve Replacement\n简介\nHere is a replacement guide for a faulty water inlet valve in a Kenmore 80 Series Washer. The water inlet valve connects the two water hoses to the machine and controls the flow of both hot and cold water to the washing machine. There are some issues that arise from a faulty water inlet valve such as the cold/hot water not turning off, the wash tub won’t stop filling with water, the washer starts draining before the wash cycle starts, or the wash tub won’t fill with water. In order to correct any one of these issues, replacement of the water inlet valve is necessary.\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\nMoving the washer\nMove the washer away from the wall without unplugging any electric outlets or water hoses.\n步骤 2\nShut off electricity and water supply\nUnplug the washer from the electric wall outlet.\nTurn off the hot and cold water supply valves by rotating the valves in a clockwise rotation.\n步骤 3\nDisconnect water hoses (hot and cold)\nUse the groove joint pliers to remove the hot and cold water hoses in a counter-clockwise rotation.\nPlace removed hoses in a bucket to catch the leaking residual water.\nUse a sticky note to distinguish hot and cold hoses if the color-coating metals are not provided.\n步骤 4\nMove the control panel out of the way\nRemove plastic endcaps at either end.\nUnscrew the screws at either end using the Phillips head screwdriver.\nRotate the panel up.\n步骤 5\nUnplug wire connector\nPress sides of upper-connector and pull upwards.\n步骤 6\nSnap out spring clips\nPry open the spring clips using the flat head screwdriver.\n步骤 7\nTilt cabinet towards you\nSlide out and remove the shell of the washer.\n步骤 8\nRemove wire connectors from valve (hot and cold)\nPull connectors directly towards you.\nProperly distinguish hot(red) and cold (white) connectors.\n步骤 9\nRemove mounting screws\nUse the 5/16” nutdriver to unscrew both mounting screws.\n步骤 10\nRemove clamp from interior water hose\nUse the groove joint pliers to press clamp and slide down from water hose.\nRemove valve out from back panel.\nRemove interior water hose from inlet water valve.\n步骤 11\nInstall new water inlet valve\nSlide the interior water hose over the water inlet valve.\nUse groove joint pliers to depress the clamp and secure the water hose to the valve.\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n结论\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n3其他贡献者\nNathan Johnson\n撰写一个指南\n1指南评论\nNice but you did not share the most complicated part.  putting the shell back on.  its not just simple.  corner slots, getting all slots aligned without damaging the inlet dispenser above the tub.  then having the front side seat on the frame.  i have spent more time and frustration on getting the shell back on verses the entire valve replacement.\nWhiskey Piper\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-142361\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/142361/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-142361\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/142361\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"

Kenmore products are produced by manufacturers such as LG, Electrolux, Panasonic, Daewoo Electronics, Whirlpool, and Cleva North America. Kenmore products are mainly found in brick and mortar stores like Kmart and Sears, but they can also be purchased from Amazon. In 2019, Kenmore expanded their appliances and products (grills and vacuum cleaners) to stores like Target, Home Depot, and Lowe’s.\nThe first Kenmore washing machine debuted in 1927 and by 1936, Kenmore had sold over 1 million laundry products. However, the first washing machine was not featured in the Sears catalog and there are no known photos of its existence. According to Sears,\nnearly a third of all American homes contain at least one Kenmore product\n. In 2017, the appliance relationship between Sears and Whirlpool was terminated and later in 2018, the overarching parent company of Sears and Kenmore, Sears Holdings, filed for bankruptcy. As a result, Kenmore products are no longer sold in Canada, but repair services and parts continue to be available throughout the Canadian market.\nThe Kenmore 90 Series was introduced in 2002 and is a top load washing machine. Its dimensions are: 43.13 x 27 x 26 inches. It has a capacity of 3.2 cubic feet for the Super Capacity Plus laundry load size.\nAdditional Information\nKenmore Appliances\nOuter Case Removal—Youtube Video\nKenmore 90 Series Review\n5其他贡献者\nMel"

Look for broken or loose wires, failed terminals, or wires not pressed into connectors far enough.\nA potential cause of a control not functioning is corrosion on connections. Observe connections and check for continuity with an ohmmeter.\nConnectors: Look at the top of the connector. Check for broken or loose wires. Check for wires not pressed into the connector far enough to engage metal barbs.\nResistance checks must be made with the washer unplugged or power disconnected.\nSafety First!\nBefore you begin, remember that safety is paramount. Always unplug your appliance before attempting any repairs or diagnostics. This precaution is crucial to prevent electric shock or damage to your appliance.\nUnderstanding Your Washer:\nThis guide covers various problems, from water inlet problems to agitation issues or unexpected leaks. We’ve broken down each problem into three key sections:\nProblem:\nIdentifies the specific issue you're experiencing.\nWhy It Happens:\nProvides a brief explanation of potential causes.\nHow to Fix:\nOffers step-by-step solutions to resolve the issue.\nReady to Solve the Issue?\nWith this guide in hand, you're well-equipped to handle washer repairs on your Calypso with ease. Let’s dive in and get your washer running smoothly again!\nPF — Power Failure Error\nWhy It Happens?\n“PF” flashes if the washer loses power during a running cycle. The washer does not flash “PF” when it is first plugged in.\nHow to Fix?\nPress START to continue the cycle from the moment that power was lost, or press STOP/CANCEL to clear the display and completely cancel the cycle.\nIf the above does not work, check the machine controller\nFL — Flood Condition\nWhy It Happens?\n“FL” flashes if any overfill condition occurs. This condition occurs when excessive water in the tub causes the overfill switch to trip. The control must realize that the trip was due to an overfill condition instead of a suds lock condition in order for “FL” to be displayed.\nHow to Fix?\nWith an overfill condition, the beeper repeats a warning every 10 seconds with no time out. The pump is cycled in drain mode for 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off until the overfill switch resets or power is discontinued to the unit.\nCheck pump for possible obstructions.\nCheck valve for leaks.\nSTOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nEr — Processor Reset Error\nWhy It Happens?\nThis error code is displayed if the control failed to save cycle information during a power failure. This does not generate an error code beep.\nHow to Fix?\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nLF — Long Fill\nWhy It Happens?\nIf the water fill time exceeds ten(10) minutes, the water valves are turned off, and “LF” is flashed.\nHow to Fix?\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nCheck that the water supply valves are on.\nCheck inlet valve screens.\nCheck water supply pressure.\nCE — Communications Error\nWhy It Happens?\nIf there is any breakdown in communication between the machine controller and the motor controller, “CE” flashes and the unit beeps once.\nHow to Fix?\nMake sure the drive motor harness does not have a bad connection.\nAfter disconnecting power to the unit, try scraping this coating off the pins.\nCheck for continuity between the serial communication pins P4 to P2 with the connectors in place.\nCheck the quick disconnect at the motor terminal.\nCheck for possible obstruction that may have caused motor to overheat.\nCheck motor controller\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nLd — Long Drain\nWhy It Happens?\n\"Ld\" flashes if it takes longer than 5 minutes to pump out water to a point where the operating pressure switch resets.\nHow to Fix?\nCheck the pump & sump for obstructions & operation.\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nCA or CI — Average Current Limit or Instantaneous Current Limit\nWhy It Happens?\n\"CA\" flashes if a status signal comes back from the motor controller that a current limit has been breached, the unit will return to standby mode and display either \"CA\" for average current limit trip or \"CI\" for instantaneous current limit trip.\nHow to Fix?\nThis may signify problems with the drive motor, thermal protector, or motor controller.\nTry washing smaller loads, using the correct amount of HE detergent.\nCheck for objects under the Nutate Plate.\nCheck for proper installation of the recirculation tube.\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\noL — Open Relay\nWhy It Happens?\n\"oL\" signifies a failure of the relay in the open position. With this failure no power can be supplied to the motor controller.\nHow to Fix?\nCheck machine control\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nSr — Stuck Relay\nWhy It Happens?\n\"Sr\" signifies a failure of the relay in the closed position. With this failure, power to the motor controller cannot be turned off by the machine controller.\nHow to Fix?\nCheck pins 1 and 5 of P16 of the machine controller, and pins 1 and 2 of P1 of the motor controller. This should have AC line voltage when the motor controller is powered.\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nLs or Lid — Lid Switch Error\nWhy It Happens?\nThe control should flash this error code if it cannot detect the lid switch opening and closing properly. This error code may also be used if there is a disagreement between the motor and machine controllers on the state of the lid switch. The control should not allow the unit to run in this condition.\nHow to Fix?\nOpen the lid or press STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nCheck the lid switch if shorted or open.\nFL — Open Lid Flashing Display Time\nWhy It Happens?\nIf the lid opens while the unit is in running mode, the time remaining will flash in the display.\nHow to Fix?\nClose the lid and press START to continue with the cycle.\nSL — Suds Lock\nWhy It Happens?\n\"SL\" is displayed when the motor controller senses a suds lock condition by analyzing the current draw on the drive motor. If a potential suds lock is detected, the control tries up to 3 times to clean out the unit with a mini-cycle.\nHow to Fix?\nSee the \"Use and Care Guide.\"\nCheck the pump & sump for obstructions and operation.\nThis may indicate an extra heavy load, excessive detergent & suds, or non-HE detergent use.\nPress STOP/CANCEL to clear the display.\nob — Out Of Balance\nWhy It Happens?\n\"ob\" is displayed when off-balance detection occurs. The motor controller sends a signal to the machine controller that the washer is in an unrecoverable off-balance condition, causing the machine to shut off and display \"ob.\"\nHow to Fix?\nThe lid must be opened before restarting the cycle.\nRedistribute the load, close the lid, and press START to continue.\nMatt Zieminski\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

(Several Elite models have been released since then.)  It has a set of automatic dispensers that dispense powdered or liquid detergent, bleach, and fabric softener at the proper times in the wash cycle.  The dispenser disassembles easily for cleaning.  It has a set of five pre-programmed wash cycles plus optional cycle modifiers for soil level, prewash, extended spin, water temperature, spin speed, and a second rinse.  The water level is automatically set and maintained for maximum water savings.  The drum is spring and shock mounted to reduce noise and vibrations.  A high speed spin cycle removes more water so clothes dry faster.\nThe washer requires the use of the recommended amount of High-Efficiency (HE) detergent.  Use of regular detergent, or too much HE detergent, will create an excess of suds, in which case an automatic suds detector will cause the washer to enter a suds removal cycle, delaying the wash cycle completion.  Always follow the detergent makers recommended amounts.\nTroubleshooting\nIf the washer detects a failure during operation, it will stop the cycle, flash an error code on the Estimated Time Remaining display, and beep four times repeatedly to attract the user's attention.\nCommon error codes\nSud -- an excess level of suds has been detected, and the washer is trying to rinse them away.\nFH -- Not enough water entering from the supply hoses.\nF02 -- Drain blocked, kinked, drain filter plugged, or drain pipe exits too far above the washer.\nFdL -- Door lock failure.\nF11 -- Communications between the front panel and control unit are failing.\nAdditional Information\nWikipedia: Kenmore Appliances\nDuet-Aid_also-Kenmore-HE3.pdf\n5其他贡献者\nWalter Galan"

    "content": "Kenmore Elite HE3 Washing Machine central control unit Replacement\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\ncentral control unit\nMy 13 year old Kenmore HE3 washer failed to power on the other day. No error codes, no lights. I checked to be sure the breaker had not tripped and that the outlet actually had power. Everything was OK, except the washer simply did not get any power.\n步骤 2\nI had downloaded both the Owner's Manual and the Service Manual for this washer, so I looked thru them for a solution. The only thing I found was the recommendation in the Troubleshooting section of the Service Manual that it was likely the CCU failing.\n步骤 3\nThe Manual suggests testing by unplugging the washer from power, waiting a few minutes & then plugging it back into power. If you do NOT hear an audible CLICK noise, replace the CCU.  I did this and did NOT hear anything. We need a new central control unit.\n步骤 4\nBefore beginning any disassembly, be sure to UNPLUG the washer from the power outlet. SAFETY FIRST!\n步骤 5\nThe central control unit (CCU) is located under the top panel of the washer, mounted to the rear frame support. To remove the top panel, use the Torx bit and driver to remove the three screws on the top back edge of the top panel. Do not lose these. A good idea is to put them in a zip lock bag and tape them to the front of the washer.\n步骤 6\nTo complete the top panel removal, slide the panel back about an inch & lift the rear edge of the panel. The panel should come off easily. Set it aside out of the way.\nTo make this easier and to be ready for the re-assembly, go ahead and CLOSE the washer door.\n步骤 7\nThe CCU looks like the picture here. Now is the time to take pictures of the front side and left side of the CCU to assist in the proper re-assembly after swapping in the replacement part.\n步骤 8\nThere are three plastic tabs securing the CCU to the rear frame. Use a flat blade screw driver to CAREFULLY lift the edges of the tabs so the CCU can be slowly moved towards the front of the washer.\nRemove the old CCU.\n步骤 9\nOrder a replacement CCU. There are a number of sources you can use. We purchased from a reputable appliance parts source in town which we have used for stove parts in the past. Be sure to provide the model and serial number of the washer so you get the right part.\nOnce your replacement part arrives, compare it to the old part to be sure you have the correct part!\n步骤 10\nBe careful plugging things in. These connections are not robust. You do not want to break anything.\n步骤 11\nPut the top panel on the washer and slide it into position. Locate your screws for the top panel & re-install them using the Torx bit and driver.\nBe sure the door to the washer is CLOSED before re-connecting the washer to power.\nConnect the power for the washer. You should her a CLICK from the washer. You are ready to test.\n步骤 12\nLIGHTS... CAMERA... ACTION! We have lights on the washer!\nI ran a short cycle, water only, to test. It ran perfectly.\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n结论\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n6等其他人完成本指南。\n1其他贡献者\nkasten39828\n撰写一个指南\n7指南评论\nI just replaced the CCU and the number 2 showed up.

It might be a stuck water pressure switch… it is attached to the inside wall of the washer. You may have banged it while servicing the CCU. Try tapping it GENTLY with the handle of a screwdriver.

    "title": "Repairing Kenmore Elite HE3 Washer Control Board Relays - iFixit 维修指南",
    "content": "Repairing Kenmore Elite HE3 Washer Control Board Relays\n简介\nThe Kenmore Elite HE3 washers will stop their cycle and display an error code if they detect a problem.  Two error codes seem prevalent, FDL and F11.  FDL indicates a failure of the door lock mechanism.  F11 indicates an error in communication with the control board and the front panel. Clearing the error and restarting the cycle may fix the problem temporarily, but is not a permanent fix.\nOne condition known to cause the problem is that the door latch relay on the control board can become coated with carbon due to excessive arcing.  This guide will explain how to access and clean or replace the relays.\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\nOpen the locked door manually\nThe F-DL door lock error may indicate an inability to open the door, trapping your damp clothes inside.  This first step is optional, and explains how to release the door lock manually.\nUnplug the washing machine!\nUsing a Torx T20 screwdriver or a 9/32\" socket wrench or driver, remove the three screws along the bottom front of the washer, and remove the panel.\nReach up inside the right hand side behind the door latch, and you should be able to feel a 1\" diameter ring.  Grab the ring with your fingers, and pull it down toward the floor.  It will release the door lock.\n步骤 2\nSafety first!\nDANGER!\nImproper handling of live electrical circuits can cause electrocution, fire, and/or death!  Do not attempt to duplicate these repairs yourself unless you understand how to safely perform electronic repairs in general.  If you do, be sure you take proper safety precautions.\nWear safety glasses when soldering.  You could spatter molten solder or rosin in your eye and go blind.  Unplug the washer before opening the cabinet.  You could electrocute yourself.  Wash your hands thoroughly after handling lead solder (especially if you are a smoker.)\nWARNING!\nIf you try this and do it wrong you could wreck your circuit board.  You could wreck your washer.  Your washer could unexpectedly start running water and flood your house (that actually happened to a friend of mine who also owned this washer.)  You could burn yourself.  You could burn your house down.\nI am not kidding about any of these safety precautions or risks.  And I can not be held responsible for actions you take on your own.  You assume full responsibility for any consequences of following this guide.  Call a qualified repair person if you are uncomfortable with any of these steps.\n步骤 3\nRemove the top panel\nUnplug the main power cord.\nTo remove the lid, remove the three screws along the back that hold it in place using either a T20 Torx screwdriver or a 9/32\" socket driver.\nSlide the top panel toward the back of the machine about one half of an inch, and lift the top panel up and off.\n1条评论\n步骤 4\nMark the wires\nMark the wires and note how the cables are routed, so you can return them to their original routes after disassembly.\nEither apply wire labels, or take a fine-tipped permanent marker and as you disconnect each connector mark it with the two letter name of the mating socket, which you will find stamped on the plastic of the control unit's housing.  A flashlight will help reading the letters along the left side of the control unit.\n步骤 5\nAccess the main controller board\nRemove the control unit by very gently prying up the two outside tabs that hold it to the top crossbar with a flat bladed screwdriver and simultaneously sliding the control unit toward the front of the washer.\nOnly the outer two tabs have a locking notch holding the control unit to the crossbar. The middle tab is there just for support.\nOpen the gray housing of the control unit by gently prying the side tabs open.\nRemove the circuit board the same way, by gently prying open the tabs holding it down.\n步骤 6\nCircuit board repair and replacement\nThere are three or five relays on the circuit board.  K6 is an OMRON G2RL-1A-E, 12VDC, and rated to switch 16A at 250 VAC.  K1 and K4 are both OMRON G5LE-1-VD, 12 VDC, and rated to switch 10A at 250 VAC.\nK1 controls the door lock solenoid.  I found the contacts on it were blackened due to arcing.  I didn't bother to find out what the other two relays do, but I cleaned them all anyway.  Another repairer says that only K1 & K4 were inspected; K1 had significant contanimation & K4 looked new by comparison.  Treated K1 only with all problems resolved!\nUnsolder one relay at a time from the circuit board, clean or replace it, then solder it back in position.\nTo unsolder a relay, start by heating the solder at one end of the relay, and gently pull the relay's plastic package with a finger on the hand holding the circuit board. Use solder wick to remove excess solder.  After making progress at one end, switch to desoldering the contacts at the other end of the relay in the same fashion.\nTo clean a relay, open its plastic case. Blow out the dust and grit.  Dress the relay contacts with a small piece of folded-in-half 200-400 grit sandpaper, treated with contact cleaner. Replace the plastic case on the relay.\nSolder the relay back onto the circuit board, and repeat with the next relay until all relays are cleaned and/or replaced.\n5条评论\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n结论\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n20等其他人完成本指南。\n10其他贡献者\njadeters\n16指南评论\n\"Open the gray housing of the control unit by gently prying the side tabs open.\"  Gently is the operative word here, I broke both tabs, could use a new cover.  Found K1 clean as a whistle, no suspect solder joints. Just cleaned the board edge contacts and up and running.  We will see how long it lasts.\nRichard Sandell\n-\nwell its good but i think i am not facing problems regarding control board i think its main machine....\nhttp://www.tristaterepairs.com/washer-re...\nAndre Matthew\n-\nI'm doing this exact repair and have noted that there is a lot of carbon on the one relay. i've also noticed that the relay is $1.26 at digikey and for an extra buck you can get the 16A version to replace the 10A version that keeps getting burnt out.\nawr\n-\nWhat is it when the relay k4 lights up for a split second before error F11\nRuth\n-\nHey guys! Just wanted to tell anyone who's mentally (and miserably) preparing themselves to have to fix their washer.\nI had same problem: an f11 error that I could not clear....2 weeks of trying. I unplugged it, plugged it back in....i did this repeatedly....and nothing. Still had that error.\nAnyway, when I finally got 'ready' to do this repair I took the stacked-on-top dryer off of it and in a last ditch effort, decided to plug it in.... you know, just one last time .... and I'll be a son of a b*tch! The %#*@ thing works. No code. No problems at all.\nI've no clue as to whether the dryer being on top of it had anything to do with it, but one must admit, it sure is odd.....\nAnyway..... you might just try leaving it unplugged for a few hours and always make that 1 last attempt! Ya never know.\nWhew. I dodged that bullet.

You need to get it to stop. Let's walk through some causes and solutions.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外一个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nShut Off the Water and Dry Everything\nShut off the water supply to the washing machine\n.\nIt will help you to get everything dry, and you may notice that the wall mounted shutoff valves leak when you are doing this. You have a few questions to ask once the water is off.\nFirst, dry everything off. It is essential to dry everything off first because then the leak is easier to spot.\nYou may even notice things like the location of the moisture as you are drying the machine. Be thorough.\nWhen you are ready to search for the leak, turn the water back on.\nWhen Does It Leak?\nIf the machine\nleaks constantly\n, running or not, that points to a leak that is under constant pressure. Most of the pressure type leaks will be to the rear of the machine.\nFirst place to check is the valves and hoses and connections that supply water to the machine. If you find any leaking, try to tighten them and check again.\nWatch carefully, as water can run down a hose from a leaking connection, and mislead you as to the leak location.\nSometimes putting your hand around a hose will allow you to see if water is running down a hose from above, as the water will run over or onto your hand.\nNext place to look is the solenoid water valves that are internal to the machine. If the valve body is cracked, or a seal has failed, it will drip. Replace it.\nYou may have a machine which fills the drum or tub with water even when shut off. This is a failed solenoid valve and you should just replace the valve.\nKeep in mind that 20 psi is needed for most solenoid valves to close properly. You can put a pressure gauge on a hose bib to check the water pressure in your home.\nIf the machine\nleaks only when running\n, observation is your best tool. Observing your running washing machine may be like watching paint dry, but it may also allow your floors to dry!\nDoes it leak when the machine is pumping out the water?\nThis is the most common failure because the volume of water is large, and there are many places where leaks can occur simply from wear and tear. Also the lint in the water can cause clogs which lead to leakage.\nIf the leak is near the front, you should check the pump for leakage. Check the filters located at the front of the machine as well. Start at\nPump and Filter Failures\nbelow.\nIf toward the rear, it is likely a problem with the drain hose. We will walk through those possibilities below at\nClogged Drain Hose\n.\nThe problem may also be a clog in your home plumbing system. This will likely leave the biggest puddle, and the surface of the wall behind the machine will likely be wet. Go to\nClogged Drain Hose\nfor more.\nDoes it leak during the wash cycle?\nIt can be the water level pressure tube that has cracked or come off. This will be a significant leak, and will likely lead to the machine overflowing as well. Go to\nOverfilling\n, below.\nYour machine will have a vent for the drum which is on the upper rear of the machine. If your leak is from the drum vent, go to\nFaulty Drum Vent\n, below.\nIt can also be from a failing or damaged door seal boot. Go to\nDoor Seal Failure\nfor more steps.\nOccasionally a leak can arise from overfilling,\nOverfilling\ndown below.\nIt could be the tub seal or tub gasket.\nThe tub gasket leak will be found at the rear of the machine.\nThe tub seal failure will be located under the middle of the machine,\nGo to\nTub Seal Failure\nfor more info.\nDoes it leak when the machine is filling with water?\nThis could be related to the machine overfilling and overflowing onto the floor.\nGo to\nOverfilling\nfor more information\nThis may be a problem with your solenoid valve, and the internal hoses that are connected to it. Go to\nInternal Leaks\n, below.\nYour detergent dispenser may have a leak, or a crack or a clog, either in the body of it, or in the attached hoses. This will be most apparent in the portion of the cycle where the machine is filling or is sending water through the dispenser. Go to\nInternal Leaks\n, below.\nPump and Filter Failures\nPump Failure\nDrain Hose Being Removed From Pump\nThe problems with the pump can be either hose related, crack related, or seal related.\nThe hoses can shift on the pump. If the pump has been replaced recently this is a common failure. Reinstall the hoses. Make sure the clamps are tight and properly positioned, so they grab the outlet where the hose is placed.\nCheck the pump body for cracks. Sometimes the body will crack and one way to check is to push on the body and outlets of the pump while it is in place. Better still is to remove it and inspect it closely. If you can observe it while running, that is the best of all, especially if you have dried everything first. You will need to turn on the water for this check.\nThe bellows (hose) from the drum or tub to the pump can be cracked or have sipped off partially. The leak will be substantial and almost continuous when the machine is operating. You may feel water there that has run down from above so make sure you dry everything and test.\nFilter Problem\nAlmost all LG front load washing machines will have a filter which is located near the pump, and has a number of seals that can leak.\nFilter Location (lower left front)\nLike the pump, there are also hoses attached to the filter, that can either come off or become cracked. If you find any cracked hoses, replace them.\nIf there is a small hose attached to the pump to allow the machine to be drained of residual water, it is another source for leaks, especially if the plug in the hose becomes worn. Check to see that the plug is snug, and if not, replace it.\nLeaks can also occur after cleaning the filter if it is improperly installed. Remove and reinstall the filter, and make sure it goes fully into place.\nCheck the filter housing body and lid for cracks, if there are any, replace it.\nCheck the seals on the filter, careless installation can cut or crack them.\nClogged Drain Hose\nIf you are here because the symptoms point to a problem with the drain hose, check these items:\nCheck the hose for clogs especially downstream of the anti-siphon vent, and at the vent itself as there is a sharp and narrowed bend in the outlet there.which is usually located on the rear bulkhead (panel) of some LG machines.\nCheck the drain hose for cracks. Some hoses are made of a corrugated plastic material rather than a rubber material and can be damaged or cracked. Stretch the hose and flex it and look carefully.\nThe home plumbing system may have a clog or partial clog, which will cause it to overflow when the pump starts emptying the machine. Since the flow is quite fast from the pump, a partially clogged pipe may not drain quickly enough and will overflow where the drain hose enters it. The wall near the drain pipe may be wet too. If you see these signs, clear any clogs from the plumbing and then test.\nOverfilling\nYour washing machine can have too much of a good thing when it fills too much. When a machine is overfilled, water can more easily escape. Because a front load machine doesn’t have an open top, the machine will not overflow as readily.\nYour LG front load washer’s water level can be observed through the front door which is transparent. It also will not allow the door to be opened unless the machine can sense that it is empty, or the water level is low enough.\nTo check this you should first check the tube that leads to the water level switch/sensor. Make sure it isn't clogged. You can clear it by blowing through it. If you can't blow through it, you should remove it and either clean or replace it.\nYour LG  front load washer uses a device that varies the frequency of a resonant circuit by moving coils with a diaphragm. This has no contacts and thus is very reliable, You can usually check it by getting into a diagnostic mode for your particular machine. A quick check is to meter the component It should have a resistance of 21-23 Ω\nThe solenoid valves may not be closing completely, and may leak water during the cycle. Your machine may have an\nFE\nerror if the level gets too high.\nIf the components check out, you should consider replacing the main control board since this is an operational failure and not a physical failure.\nDoor Seal Failure\nThis seal can fail in a number of different ways.\nThe seal can have slipped out of place, which will cause a leak.\nThe seal is dirty which can prevent it from sealing properly.\nThe seal is damaged or punctured, which will also cause a leak.\nYou can look for signs of a leaking door seal, mainly by the location of evidence of leaking, it will be near the front of the machine. Especially with punctures, the location of deposits can help you pinpoint the leak.\nClean the seal thoroughly, especially parts that will be in contact with the door.\nWhile cleaning, check the seal to see that it is installed correctly and not rolled or improperly seated\nOnce you have checked for proper installation, stretch the seal, and look all over it for tears or punctures. If you find one, replace the seal.\nInternal Leaks\nThere are three main sources of internal leaks, other than items we have already addressed, like the pump, drain hose and filter. These include the detergent dispenser, and associated hoses, and the water inlet solenoid valve and the tub seal. You will need to operate the machine with water, so turn the water supply on.\nDetergent Dispenser Damage\nLG Front load washers generally have the detergent dispenser located on the front of the machine, either in a small drawer or under a movable cover.\nDetergent Dispenser Disconnected for Removal\nThis dispenser can be damaged or cracked and will leak when water is running through it as the detergent is mixed into the wash water. If it is cracked, replace it.\nLeaks can happen while the machine is filling or during the wash cycle.\nYou should watch the operation of your washer with the top cover removed. To avoid shock hazard avoid touching internal parts of the machine while it is operating. Look and listen for leaks.\nFeeling the area of the dispenser and underneath it\nwith the machine unplugged\n(no shock hazard) can help to locate leaks.\nThe hoses from the detergent dispenser to the drum can also become partially clogged and will cause the dispenser to overflow.\nIf you see this overflow condition, remove the hoses and clean them out fully. Reattach them afterward. Test the machine.\nDetergent and fabric softener can deposit residues which will obstruct the hose (there may also be small parts dropped in by small hands too that can contribute).\nThe hoses from the detergent dispenser to the washer tub can become detached or cracked and will cause a substantial leak. Reattach the hose if possible, or replace it if damaged, making sure you check the dispenser and tub or drum for damage that may have caused the hose to come loose.\nThe water supply hoses leading to the detergent dispenser can be improperly attached, or cracked and will cause a leak. Observation is the easiest way to spot this. If you find a leak there, determine the cause and reattach or replace the hose.\nSolenoid Valve Cracked\nThe solenoid valves and attached hoses can leak. Since, in general, the water is fed from the solenoid valve to the detergent dispenser, you likely have checked the hoses already.\nThe valve itself can leak from improperly installed hoses or cracks in the body or outlets. Occasionally, a seal can fail near the coils, so check thoroughly.\nFaulty Vent Bellows Hose\nCheck the condition of the vent bellows hose attached to the washer drum.\nLook for cracks or tears.\nMake sure it is securely attached, and that the clamps are snug and the ports on the drum and vent outlet are not damaged.\nShaft Seal or Gasket Failure\nOn a front load machine, a leaking shaft seal or gasket poses a large problem, as it will lead to corrosion of the bearings located behind it. If the tub shaft gasket is leaking it is a difficult, but not impossible fix. This is not a super common leak.\nIf the bearings have failed, the repair becomes somewhat more involved, but is mainly a matter of persistence. If you have never driven a bearing out  of its seat to replace it, you might want to have a friend who has some automotive repair experience help you out. A brass drift or punch is essential if you go this route.\nAs to the leak:\nThe leak will show up at the rear of the tub.\nIt may be hard to spot, and, unhappily, you may be more aware of the bearings sounding odd.\nIf you see these conditions, it will be worthwhile to try to operate the machine with some of the covers or cabinet pieces removed so you can observe the leak directly, as you want to be sure of what's wrong before you do the repair. Turn the water back on and let the machine do its thing. If you see the leak, replace the seal.\nTub Seal Failure\nOn your LG front load washing machine the tub is made with two halves, front and rear, so that the basket can be installed inside it. Those two pieces have a rubber seal between the halves. If this seal breaks (or is installed incorrectly), it will cause a leak. This is an unusual leak.\nLook for a leak at the joint between the halves of the tub, probably best to check on the underside of the tub.\nYou may be able to see this area by opening the rear panel of the machine, which will allow you to have the machine filled with water and operating, the better to see the leak.\nBeware of the motor spinning while you look at these parts.\nFaulty Drum Vent\nThe drum vent may incorporate a valve which allows for air to circulate into and out of the drum. It may leak either because the valve is stuck, or because improper detergent is being used, too much detergent is being used or the machine is improperly leveled. If the machine is leaking from the rear vent opening check the following things.\nMake sure you are using HE type detergent. Normal detergent will create too many suds and the excess will frequently leak out the vent. Use the right detergent.\nToo much detergent (even HE type) can have the same effect as Non-HE detergent. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's recommendations.\nMake sure your machine is properly leveled. Your operating manual should have instructions for checking this.\nIf you have checked these causes, then another check is to remove the vent bellows from the drum, and check the valve located there on some machines. If it sticks open it can cause leaking. You should also make sure the bellows isn't torn or damaged as that will also cause leaking.\n1其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

Let's look at some causes and solutions! They are pretty straightforward.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外一个贡献者)\nFirst Steps\nYour first move is to try to run a drain and spin cycle. If you don’t know how, now’s the time to get acquainted with your owner’s manual. If you don’t have one, you can go to\nLG’s website\nand download one. Now some steps:\nOnce the machine is trying to drain, check the following items:\nIs water coming out of the drain hose? Is it flowing fully or just a little trickle. Is there no water?\nIf there’s no water, can you hear the pump running? If so, is it noisy? A running pump with no water coming out points to a clog or an impeller problem.\nIs there a leak anywhere? This might be a symptom of a cracked pressure hose or air dome.\nGet the items you will need to drain the machine. You will need a bucket, a shallow pan that you can pour from and some rags. You may need to drain the machine more than once, so keep these items handy.\nIf the machine didn’t pump out (Very likely) you need to drain it.\nHere is a guide\nthat will show you how. You will need more than a bowl for the water in this case!\nNow we look at the causes! There are two main systems involved when your machine will not pump out. One is the pump system, the other is the water level sensing system. We will start with the pump system and its components.\nFailed Pump\nThe most obvious problem. It doesn’t pump out because the pump doesn’t work. There are two main points of failure for the pump. The motor and the impeller. We will start by removing the pump.\nHere's a guide to that\n. There might be some differences, model to model, but the basic idea is the same.\nPump Motor (red) on Pump Body\nImpeller on Pump Motor\nStart by checking the pump motor. This is a likely failure when you don’t hear the pump run at all.\nInspect the pump power connectors and make sure they are seated properly.\nUse a multimeter to measure the resistance of the winding. It should be between 10-20Ω.\nIf it is outside of this range, replace the pump motor.\nIf OK, remember to seat the connectors fully, then go to the next item.\nYou can also check the bearings to see if the motor moves freely,\nThis is more difficult because the permanent magnet motor turns by hand in impulses or steps, so it is harder to judge the condition of the bearings.\nIf you hear grinding noises when you turn the motor you should replace the pump motor.\nIf it just spins freely with little resistance to turning, or turns with a mix of free spinning and impulses, it's defective and should be replaced. Contrary to what you might expect, such free spinning means the impeller has come loose on the shaft, or the drive magnet has come loose.\nNext, check the impeller. If you can hear the pump running, but no water is being pumped, you may have either a loose impeller (mentioned above), a broken impeller, or a clog. We will look for clogs later.\nInspect the impeller for damage like chipped or missing blades.\nRemove any lint or other debris that is on the impeller or wrapped around it.\n*\nCheck the pump body for clogs or debris. Small laundry items can become lodged in the pump body and block flow. If you find any such items, remove them. We will want to check for other clogs as well. (One clog often leads to another.)\nCheck the wiring to the pump. There are connectors in that wiring path that should be disconnected and reconnected to make sure they are fully engaged. If possible, trace the wires back to the main control board, and check for continuity.\nIf everything now looks good on the pump, move on to the next step.\nClogged Hoses\nIf the hoses are clogged, little or no water will be pumped out of your machine.Clogs can happen either upstream or downstream of the pump, or sometimes in the pump body itself. We have already checked the pump body, so the next check is the drain hose.\nRemove the drain hose from the wall drain or standpipe.\nNote if the hose has been put more than 4 inches (10 CM) into the drain pipe, or if the hose outlet is over 8 feet in elevation. Correct either of these issues if you find them.\nIt may be easiest to\nremove the drain hose\nfrom the washing machine entirely so you can check the whole length for clogs.\nUse a dowel or a wire with the end folded over to run through the hose to make sure there are no clogs.\nRinsing out the hose, if possible, after you do this is a good idea as you may have dislodged debris as you checked for clogs.\nIf you find a clog, remove it.\nGo on to the next step.\nThe other place for hose clogs is the tub to pump hose. Once the pump is removed, this hose is already disconnected at one end, so it is not too hard to check.\nHere is a guide\nfor removing the tub to pump hose.\nOnce the hose is removed, check for obstructions, especially things like small hair accessories, small socks, etc. Look through the hose. Also look if possible at the outlet from the tub where the hose was installed.\nIf you have found one or more clogs, you can choose to reassemble your machine at this point and test it. Given that the machine takes time to reassemble and disassemble, you may find it worthwhile to check the water level sensing system.  But this is a lower priority if you have found substantial clogs.\nWater Level Sensing System Malfunction\nWe look at these items next because if there is a problem with them, the system is likely to cause the machine to display an error code, so you probably would already be alerted to them. Since your problem is a failure to drain, it is less likely that the washer will indicate a failure to fill. Here are some common error codes:\nYou likely could get a drain error,\nOE\n, (the O is likely supposed to represent a D and dE is used for a door error) because the washer isn’t detecting the water being pumped out.\nLess likely is the overflow error,\nFE\n,  because this occurs when the machine believes that the water level is too high. It is supposed to start the pump when it detects this condition. If your pump is defective you might get this error, because it can’t pump out the excess.\nYou could possibly get an inlet error,\nIE\nbecause the machine doesn’t sense that it is filling. It might actually physically overflow because it doesn’t sense the water level rising. (Most LG machines will shut off the water inlet valve after 20-25 minutes if the central control board doesn’t receive a full signal when the machine is filling).\nThe pressure sensor error,\nPE\nis discussed below.\nPressure Hose\nThe main culprit in these malfunctions is the pressure hose.\nPressure Sensor and Pressure Hose\nAir Dome and Pressure Hose\nAny air leak, either at the fittings or in the hose itself, will cause problems.   As the air pressure from the air trapped by the water bleeds off, the machine will eventually think it is empty (no pressure=no water). It may try to top itself off with additional water and could overflow.\nExamine the entire hose, especially where it is clipped to the machine for breaks or cuts or to see if it has become disconnected or loosened at either end.\nWhile leaving the hose connected to the pressure sensor, blow into it and see if you find an air leak.\nThere could be a loose connection to the pressure sensor, or to the air dome, so replace the connector at the air dome and then remove the connection at the pressure sensor and blow to check the air dome.\nA clogged hose will also cause problems because sometimes it may detect the water filling the tub, it can't detect when it empties, as the clog won’t let the trapped air out.\nIf the hose checks out, move to the next step.\nAny problems:\nIf the hose is cracked, replace it\nIf the hose fits loosely on the connector at each end, you can try hose clamps, but replacement is wise because the hose has probably stretched.\nIf the air dome has cracked, replace it.\nIf the hose is clogged, clear it, or replace it.\nPressure Sensor\nThe Pressure sensor can fail, and usually will cause an error code on the display (\nPE\n). You can test it with a multimeter.\nCheck the resistance of the sensor, it should be between 21 and 23 Ω. If it's outside this range, replace it.\nDepending on your model, you can also test it using buttons on the control panel to set the display to give actual frequency readings. If you can locate a service manual you can get the button combination needed. They should be pressed simultaneously. Sometimes you will need to enter a diagnostic mode. Some likely candidates:\nSoil + Delay Wash\nWash/Rinse +Soil Level\nWash/Rinse + Delay Wash\nCustom Program +Pre-Wash\nIn each case there will be a number representing a frequency displayed; the number x .1kHz is the water level frequency. When only 2 digits are available (or 0XX) then it is 2X.X kHz. A higher number indicates empty. 21.4 kHz +/-  usually full, 25.0kHz +/- usually empty. If it is below 10kHz or above 31kHz you will get a\nPE\nerror.\nWiring Harness and Connector Problems\nThis is the last stop before the control board. Testing the wiring harness if all of the components are testing good, before replacing the control board is a good precaution, as control boards are expensive.\nBefore replacing the control board you may want to try disconnecting and reconnecting all of the cables that are connected to the control board.\nThen test the function of the washing machine.\nIf you have a service manual or tech bulletin you can check the connections that have to do with the drain pump and the pressure sensor.\nIf the harness doesn't check out for continuity, replace or repair it if possible.\nIf the harness checks out then go to the next step.\nMain Control Board\nThe end of the line. You have tested the other components and they check out. Replace the control board.\nRelated Pages\nLG Front Loader Washing Machine Not Spinning\n1其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

Clothes are staying too wet. Let's look at causes and solutions.\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外3个贡献者)\nThe Basics\nFor the causes that follow, we assume:\nYour washing machine is plugged in and hasn't been accidentally unplugged. Check that it has power.\nThat it is able to fill with water. If so, turn the water off for now.\nThat you have adjusted the load. (UE errors)\nRedistribute the laundry. Out-of-balance conditions can terminate a spin cycle, or the machine may just jump to the end of the spin, and your clothes will be wet still.\nRemove some of the laundry. Your machine may be overloaded and that will lead to trouble with spinning.\nYou have run a Reset sequence on your machine. If not, unplug it for 5 minutes then plug it back in and try the cycle again.\nYou have checked to see that your machine is properly leveled. Both front-to-back and side-to-side out-of-level can affect the machine’s ability to balance loads.\nOn to the causes!\nDoor Latch/Lock (May have\ndE\nerror)\nYour LG washing machine will refuse to spin (or may not even start a cycle) if it cannot detect the door being locked. If the latching mechanism fails this will be the case. Over time the latch will wear, and cause problems.  Since the door latch is both accessible and easy to replace, and relatively inexpensive, it is worth doing if there is any sign that the latch has problems.\nAmong the problem signs, you may notice that your door starts refusing to latch properly when you close it. You may hear buzzing or humming from the door latch, or no click or sound at all. There are several things to check.\nIs the door strike bent or broken? If so, replace it.\nAre the connections to the door switch loose? You can check the wiring to the latch mechanism.\nIs the door latch/lock worn out?\nSometimes the lock will not secure the door and needs to be replaced.\nYou should hear it click when the start/pause button is pressed to start a cycle. If it rattles or buzzes that’s a sign of failure. Replace it.\nHere is a guide for this replacement\n.\nSuspension Issues (May have\nUE\nerrors)\nThe suspension of your washing machine allows it to deal with a certain amount of imbalance in the load. It runs a sequence called “untangling” and senses when the load is more evenly distributed. Over time the suspension components wear and the movement of the basket and drum becomes less damped. At some point the machine is unable to properly sense the load, or the vibrations become too severe, and it won’t spin. The main item that fails on a front loader is the dampers or “shock absorbers”. There are also some springs, but they don’t fail much.\nDamper Removed From Washer\nYou can get an idea of the condition of the dampers by pushing down sharply on the drum or tub and see if it rebounds without bouncing more than once. If it bounces to a stop with two or three bounces, the suspension needs replacing.\nMake sure to replace all of the dampers at the same time. If one is worn, others are sure to follow soon after. There are usually 3 or 4 damper units. Make sure to replace them with the matching part, so get an original equipment part number.\nHere is a guide for this replacement.\nNot Draining (May have\nOE\nerror)\nYour LG washer will not spin if it detects (or thinks it detects) that it has not drained. There are several potential causes. They can be divided into two main problems.\nWater Level Sensing Problems\nThe water level sensing system uses an air dome to provide a trapped portion of air which is squeezed by water in the drum as it fills. The resulting air pressure pushes against a diaphragm which moves a part inside a coil of wire and the control unit senses this. This system is very reliable since there are no contacts to fail.\nPressure Sensor\nAir Dome With No Hose\nPressure sensor failure\nThe simple test is to check the resistance of the coil. If it is between 21 and 23 Ω it is likely fine. Outside of this range, replace the sensor.\nYou can check to see if the pressure sensor has failed by its frequency output. Consult the Tech sheet in your machine to learn how.\nAir dome and pressure hose problems\nIs the air dome cracked or are the mounting screws loose?\nIs the hose connection at the air dome blocked? You should remove the hose from the connection to check.\nIs the pressure hose obstructed or pinched? You can blow through the hose to check.\nHere is a guide that may be helpful\nIf everything shows good, go on to the next step.\nPump System Problems\nIf your machine can’t drain it won’t spin. If it doesn’t drain sufficiently it will stop the cycle. Spinning only starts when the machine senses that the water level has gone down sufficiently.\nPump issues\nIs the pump filter clogged? This is an often overlooked problem that can lead to slow draining and no spin conditions.\nIs the pump operating at all? Listen for pump operation.\nIs the pump actually pumping? The impeller may be loose on its shaft. If this is the case, the pump will probably be noisy and make grinding noises. You will need a new pump.\nPump hose issues. If the hoses are clogged, the pump either can’t pump out the water or can’t get the water to pump.\nCheck the drain hose for problems.\nIs it clogged?\nIs it too far down the standpipe?\nIs the standpipe more than 8 feet above the washer?\nHere is a\nguide to help with removing the hose\n.\nThe tub-to-pump hose may be clogged. Small pieces of laundry can make their way down the hose and become lodged. They will prevent the machine from draining properly and it won’t spin if it is too full.\nMotor Failure (May have\nLE\nerror)\nThe motor can also be a point of failure when your washer won’t spin. On most models, the stator can be checked for correct resistance at the control board. This will also let you check for problems with the wiring from the control board to the motor.\nIs the motor connector properly seated at the control board? This connector will usually have a red, a blue, and a yellow wire. The connector itself may be gray or red.\nAre the resistance values of the stator correct?\nThis step will require a multimeter. If you aren't familiar with how to use one,\nhere is a guide\nthat will help you.\nCheck the resistance between each pair of wires, Red-Blue, Blue-Yellow, and Yellow-Red. It should be between 5 and 15Ω.\nIf the readings are different, you should check the values at the stator itself. If the stator values are correct, the problem is in your wiring harness.\nIf the harness is the problem, you can check each wire from the control board connector to the stator connector.  Some models may have a connector between the stator connector and the main wiring harness, which can allow you to check the portion of wire between that connector and the stator. Since this “pigtail” is exposed to a lot of flexing, you may have a broken wire in that segment.\nCheck each portion of each stator wire in the harness for continuity. If you find a problem replace the harness or segment (they often have part numbers on tags on them).\nIf you find a break and are willing to repair it, make sure to use wire of the proper type and size, and color if possible.\nThe motor assembly itself can also be a source of the problem. If one of the rotor magnets breaks or cracks, the motor will not run properly, and likely the washer won’t spin. The rotor bolt can also come loose which will make noise and likely lead to a no-spin condition (may not give the\nLE\nerror)\nIs the rotor bolt loose? If so, tighten it. You should reinstall it with a medium-strength threadlocker (usually blue).\nAre any of the rotor magnets broken? (You will need to remove the rotor bolt and the rotor to check, make sure to have some blue threadlocker for reinstalling the bolt.)\nHere’s a guide to help\n.\nYou should inspect the stator for cracks as well as the rotor. If these items all check out, go to the next item.\nRotor Position Sensor/ Hall Effect Sensor Failure\nMany, but not all LG washing machines utilize a hall effect sensor for sensing rotor position.  If this fails, the machine will have difficulty running, will likely not spin at high speed, and will give an LE code.\nHere is a\nguide for removing the stator\nif you need to test it. This will also give access to the Hall effect or position sensor.\nA basic test for the Hall Effect Sensor is to check for appropriate resistance. Here are two videos.\nThe first one is the most basic test\n, and the\nsecond is a functional test\nthat you can perform if the unit passes the basic test.\nControl Board Failure\nThe control board on your LG front load washer can fail and cause a no-spin condition. If you did not notice any unusual sounds from your machine before it was unwilling to spin, which might point to the bearings or spider, then this is the likely culprit.  You might have also seen any number of the error codes, and the main items responsible have tested good.\nBearing Failure\nThe bearings on your LG Front Load washer can wear out, or they can fail from water intrusion because of a failed tub seal. This can cause spin issues and may lead to a not spinning condition. You will likely hear a noise like a freight train each time your machine spins. You might say, you’ll hear it coming! This is major surgery, and it even carries the risk that the patient will die during the procedure, as removing the bearings to replace them may damage the washer tub or the bearing seats, leading to a much more expensive repair. If you can even find the part, that is.\nSpider Failure\nA failed spider is a major issue. The spider holds one end of the washer drum that turns and connects it mechanically to the motor via the shaft mounted on the spider. Repair involves tearing the machine down nearly completely. You can often detect a failed spider because the drum will rotate with a noticeable amount of eccentricity.  You will also hear thumping or clunking noises as the drum rotates slowly. For reasons that are not well understood, the spiders in many LG machines were unfinished. The alloy used for the casting can corrode readily in alkaline environments, so these unfinished units will fail. If your machine is over 5 years old this is something to watch for.\nRelated Pages\nLG Front Load Washing Machine Leaking\nLG Front Load Washing Machine Has No Water\nLG Front Load Washing Machine Not Draining\n3其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

They should only turn one-quarter turn as they are ball valves.\nBelow is a picture of the ball-type valves.\nIf they have round handles they are likely globe, gate, or angle stop valves and will take multiple turns to turn off and on. Try turning them counterclockwise. You may also have valves that have T-type handles like an outdoor faucet. They work the same way.\nIf they turn, keep going until they stop turning. It may be tricky to get this right if your valves are upside down or the handles face to the side or away from you.\nAngle stop valves are pictured below.\nIf they won't turn, try turning them clockwise. If they turn, they were already on, and you can just leave them alone.\nTip: It is a good idea to leave this type of valve about 1/8 turn from fully on. It helps to verify the actual valve position because you can just turn it toward open that little bit, and won't be as readily fooled that it is stuck in the off position\nCheck both supply valves.\nA couple of longshots:\nCheck to see if the main supply to your home is on.\nMany water heater installations will have valves for both hot and cold at the water heater. Make sure all valves at the water heater are on.\nBall Stop Valves\nAngle Stop Valves\nClogged Filter Screens\nYour machine will have filter screens located in the water inlet connections of the machine. Frequently there will also be such screens on the water supply hoses. These screens can become clogged and make the water flow slowly or almost not at all. If you use well water, you may have sediment buildup and possibly mineral buildup, especially if you have hard water.\nPlugged filter screens are a very common cause of slow filling.\nTo check them do the following:\nTurn off the water supply (you know how from the step above)\nDisconnect the hoses at both ends. (Have a rag or a bucket handy to catch the water that is in the hoses.)\nLook at the filter screens on the hoses, if they are dirty, clean them thoroughly. If the screens are badly corroded, or there are heavy mineral deposits, replace them.\nIf possible remove metal screens on hoses carefully with needle nose pliers for cleaning. Some are permanent on the hose and can’t be removed. You have to replace the hose in that case.\nMineral deposits on the inlet screens may be very hard to remove and you may need to replace the screen. Vinegar may help with cleaning them and soaking the filters in a cup of vinegar for about 15 minutes (it needs time to work) can help a lot.\nLook at the inlet screens on the machine.\nHere is a guide\nthat will show you how to remove them. If they are ok go on to the next step. Otherwise:\nYou can use an old soft toothbrush along with something to squirt water at the screens, to rinse away the bits. An old empty dish detergent bottle, especially with vinegar in it, is handy for this or just do it in a sink. If you see the screens are broken (plastic is prone to this), or break while cleaning or removing them, they should be replaced.\nIf the screens were dirty, and you cleaned all the screens, reconnect all the hoses, turn the water back on, and test the machine. If it works, you're done! If not, go to the next step.\nFaulty Door Switch / Latch\nIf your machine was filling slowly, rather than not at all, you can skip this step since it wouldn’t fill at all if the door switch or latch was bad. A quick check is to try to run a spin-only cycle. If the machine will run then the door switch is good, and you can go to the next step. If not, you should investigate the switch as it is a common failure point. If the machine senses the door is open it will not fill (for obvious reasons). Further, if the machine cannot detect that the door is locked (no lock symbol or light on the control panel, the machine will not fill.\nHere is a\nlink to a guide for replacing the door latch\non an LG machine.\nWater Inlet Solenoid Valve Failure\nAmong the most common problems that prevent your machine from properly filling with water, is a failed solenoid valve. You may notice that your machine may fill with only hot or only cold water or seems to fill slowly. Since you have already checked the filter screens, a slow fill is likely a valve problem.\nSolenoid Assembly Unlabeled\nSolenoid Assembly Labeled\nDetergent Drawer Housing - Labeled\nMarkings-Bleach,Hot,Pre-Wash,Main Wash\nOn many LG machines, there are several inlet solenoids. Often there may be three separate cold solenoids (example above), one for Pre-Wash, one for Main Wash, and one for liquid bleach dispensing. The detergent drawer assembly will be labeled to show what does what. You may notice that your machine might fill properly on regular wash cycles, but might not fill on pre-wash. This is a sign that the corresponding solenoid coil or even the corresponding valve itself has failed. You will be testing the main wash solenoid first. Unfortunately, most of these valves come as a multi-valve assembly so if one has failed you must replace the whole assembly.\nRun a normal wash cycle with water using cold water only. If nothing happens you know that the main wash cold water solenoid is likely bad.\nNext, try running a pre-wash cycle. If nothing happens you know that the pre-wash cold water solenoid is likely bad.\nNext, try filling it with hot water only. If nothing happens you know that the hot water solenoid coil.\nIf there are problems with filling with either hot or cold, you will need to move your machine so you can open the cabinet (case). Make sure it has been drained first as water is heavy.\nNext, shut the water off, disconnect the hoses and unplug the machine.\nOnce you have it open, look at the place where the water hoses connect to the machine. This is where the solenoid valves are.\nTest each solenoid valve coil for correct resistance as shown in the example pictures above.\nIf the reading is between 800-1,500 Ω (Ohms) the coil is ok. Go on to the next step.\nOutside this range, the coil is defective and the valve should be replaced.\nWater Level System Failure\nIf your machine is still filling slowly at this point you can rule out the pressure sensor, as it won't cause slow fill, only no fill or overfill, so skip this step if that is the case.\nHere are pictures of the potential causes. Note we show both ends of the pressure hose.\nPressure Sensor and Pressure Hose\nAir Dome and Pressure Hose\nWe look at these items next after the solenoid failure, because if there is a problem with them, the system is likely to cause the machine to display an error code, so you probably would already be alerted to them. Here are some common error codes:\nYou could likely get an inlet error,\nIE\nbecause the machine doesn’t sense that it is filling. Given that you are having a no-fill condition this is the most likely error code.\nThe pressure sensor error,\nPE\nis discussed below. (link)\nYou could possibly see an overflow error,\nFE\n,  because this occurs when the machine believes that the water level is too high. It is supposed to start the pump when it detects this condition, and it won’t fill.\nYou might get a drain error,\nOE\n, (the O is likely supposed to represent a D, and dE is used for a door error) because the washer isn’t detecting the water being pumped out and so it won’t try to fill.\nPressure Hose\nA frequent cause of these malfunctions is the pressure hose. Any air leak, either at the fittings or from the hose itself, will cause problems.   As the pressure from the air trapped by the water bleeds off, the machine will eventually think it is empty (no pressure=no water). It may try to top itself off with additional water and could overflow. If the pressure tube that is connected to the control is plugged, trapping the higher air pressure, the control can be fooled into thinking the machine is full, and it won’t add water.\nExamine the entire hose, especially where it is clipped to the machine for breaks or cuts or to see if it has become disconnected or loosened at either end. If the hose is cracked, replace it.\nA clogged hose will also cause problems because sometimes the sensor may detect the water filling the tub, but it can't detect when it empties, as the clog won’t let the trapped air out.\nBlow through the whole hose from the pressure sensor end with both ends disconnected.\nIf there’s a clog you can try using a wood dowel to push it through. If you can’t get the clog out, replace the hose.\nReconnect the hose to the pressure sensor, and blow into it from the air dome end and see if you find an air leak.\nReplace the connection at the air dome and then remove the connection at the pressure sensor and blow to check the air dome connection. You are looking for loose connections.\nIf either connection leaks or is loose you can just replace the hose.\nAlternatively, if you find a loose connection there is no harm in adding a small hose clamp rather than replacing the hose. Some machines use a small pinch clamp type as a standard part.\nIf the hose checks out, move to the next step.\nPressure Sensor\nAnother reason your machine won't fill is because it thinks it is already full. The water level is actually controlled by a pressure sensor connected to the washtub or drum. The Pressure sensor has a sensor coil connected to a diaphragm in it to monitor water level. The diaphragm moves in response to air trapped in the air dome and pressure hose by the water in the drum. As the water level rises, the trapped air increases in pressure. The machine monitors this air pressure with the sensor. These sensors don't often fail.\nIf the pressure sensor does fail, it will usually cause an error code on the display (\nPE\n). You can test it with a multimeter.\nCheck the resistance of the sensor, it should be between 21 and 23 Ω. If it's outside this range, replace it.\nDepending on your model, you can also test it using buttons on the control panel to set the display to give actual frequency readings. If you can locate a service manual you can get the button combination needed. They should be pressed simultaneously. Sometimes you will need to enter a diagnostic mode. Some likely candidates:\nSoil + Delay Wash\nWash/Rinse +Soil Level\nWash/Rinse + Delay Wash\nCustom Program +Pre-Wash\nIn each case there will be a number representing a frequency displayed; the number x .1kHz is the water level frequency. When only 2 digits are available (or 0XX) then it is 2X.X kHz. A higher number indicates empty. 21.4 kHz +/-  usually full, 25.0kHz +/- usually empty. If it is below 10kHz or above 31kHz you will get a\nPE\nerror.\nFaulty Control Board\nControl Board Housing\nControl Board Housing Cover Removed\nIf the solenoid valve coils checked out well two steps ago, at this point, no water likely means a failure with the main control board. You might want to consult an appliance technician for confirmation before replacing the board, as it is usually fairly costly.\nYou can run one more check if you want to be sure. If the resistance of the water valve solenoid coils is tested well, you can perform a final test to verify that the solenoid is receiving power.\nPlug in your machine, but keep the top open so you have access to the solenoid valves\nA qualitative test is to feel the appropriate solenoid coils for vibration as the cycle is activated.\nA more sure test is to use a multimeter to verify 120 volts at the solenoid terminals when activated.\nThis is a more hazardous test as you will have to plug in the machine and start a cycle to see if you get the necessary voltage. If you don’t feel able to do this test, you should consult a professional.\nThis test is most easily accomplished in the Test Mode on your machine, If you don’t have that available, as mentioned, you can just start a cycle.\nIf you don’t get voltage at the solenoid, you should replace the main control board.\n1其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

It is having trouble (it thinks) balancing the load. Not to worry; lots of things to try and to check! Let's dive in!\nBill Gilbert\n(和另外2个贡献者)\nWe can divide the problem into two groups of causes; Adjustments or Resets, and Component Issues or Failures.  We will start with the Adjustments or Resets since opening up the washer is a lot more effort.\nKeep in mind that you may find information on websites that will advocate adding springs, bungee cords, or disassembling suspension rods and adding parts to them. These \"fixes\" might work in some cases but they often give mixed results.\nFurther, the washing machines are engineered (seemingly poorly sometimes) to operate as designed. Allowing movement of the wash tub is designed so that parts are not over-stressed trying to resist loads by sheer brute force, and the machine doesn't go for walks repeatedly. So it's probably good to resist using the \"quick and dirty\" approach unless you have no alternative.\nAdjustments and Resets\nAdjust the Load\nThis is the standard LG answer to anything in this area. But it is actually valid, and the first place to start. You might think this is too easy, but a common user error is loads that are too large, or large single items, like a bedspread, that aren't distributed properly in the machine.\nStop the machine, open it, and rearrange the load. You might even want to add an item like a towel, possibly even wet, if there's only one item so that you can better balance things.\nIf the load is too large, the machine may not be able to spin at full speed, remove some of the wash items and try again.\nYou may avoid this in the future by finding out from your owner's guide, how much your machine can handle.\nStart the machine again and see if it will spin properly. If so, the problem is solved.\nIf the load is properly sized and fairly well distributed, go to the next item.\nLeveling Legs\nYour machine may be having this code because it isn't steady on its feet. This is very important with front-load machines. They have to be steady and level.\nGive your machine a push in a couple of directions and see which way it wants to tilt, if at all. if It doesn't want to tilt that's helpful, because leveling will be that much easier.\nYou should put a small level on the top of the machine to check which way it is leaning. In case you aren't sure how to use a level, here's\na link to some information\n.\nYou want to get it so it is level side to side\nand\nfront to back. So shift the level to read each direction.\nJust because it doesn't rock doesn't mean it is level.\nTry to adjust it in a spot as close as possible to where it will operate. Floors are not always super-even. and moving a machine a foot or so can make a big difference in leveling. Concrete floors can do this so beware.\nOn top load machines, an alternate quick check is to look at how centered the tub is in the door opening.\nThis is a more crude adjustment and is likely not as accurate as using a level. Further, if a suspension rod is broken you will get a false reading if you rely on it alone, and might throw your washer way out of level.\nIf you can see less of the tub rim on one side, raise that side of the machine with both front and back legs.\nWatch to see that it doesn't start rocking as you adjust the legs.\nAlso as mentioned try to adjust it in a spot as close as possible to where it will operate. You probably are close to the operating position if you are doing it this way.\nOnce you have leveled the machine, start it up again and check it. If it spins smoothly, you are done, if not, go to the next step.\nThe Washer Needs a Reset\nOccasionally the washer just needs a reset. On LG machines this is accomplished by unplugging the machine for two minutes, then plugging it back in. The previous leveling operations will help to make reduce unbalance, so no harm is done.\nComponent Issues or Failures\nNow we enter into the internal checks of the machine. These checks will sometimes only be applicable to one type of machine and we will note that in each subsection.\nLoose Rotor Mounting Nut\nThis is a common complaint on LG top load machines of older vintage and is worth checking along with the inner wash plate or agitator nut. This can also occur on front loaders but there isn't an interior fastener. The procedure is similar to that described below for the top loader.\nTo access this nut on a top loader,\nCarefully tip the machine on its rear and prop it so it doesn't go completely flat and possibly damage the outlet hose. (On a front loader, remove the rear cover).\nThen remove the motor support bracket if present.\nNext, tighten the nut that is in the center of the rotor. it is a large nut (24mm on one model, probably a good guess for others)\nThe torque value given for one model is 200kgf/cm (or 88 ft-lb 19.6 N·M) but make sure it is tight.\nIt is a large nut and can take and needs considerable torque. You may want to use an impact driver set to a low setting if you have that available.\nReassemble in reverse order\nAt this point, on a top loader, you should also check the agitator or wash plate fastener, and make sure it is also tight. (not as tight as the rotor nut though!)\nYou will need to remove the cap that is in place over that fastener.\nThere may be gunk in the area if it is loose. Clean it out, tighten the bolt, and replace the cap. Some units will have a very large nut here which needs a special wrench (38mm) to tighten. That doesn't seem to be a reported problem.\nTest the machine and see if the error is cleared.\nSuspension Rods (Top Loaders)\nThese parts are found on top load machines they allow the washer tub to be suspended and \"float\" inside the cabinet. or case of the machine. They are found on newer top-load models. They are a common cause of load imbalance error codes.\nAs they wear, their springs fatigue a very small amount, but mainly the damping effect of the assembly goes way down.\nThe main test is the bounce test.\nPush down on the washer tub or basket and release it quickly\nWhen you release it, note if it bounces or just returns to its starting position. If it bounces more than once it's defective, replace all the rods and associated components.\nSometimes you can improve the damping by applying a damping grease (one is called Nyogel 767A for example) to the rods where they pass through the plastic spring holder at the lower end of the assembly. If the plastic has begun to wear (the rod is floppy in it) just replace all the suspension rods.\nSince there are a variety of suspension rods and they all look similar, we will just list a few things to keep in mind if you are replacing or inspecting them.\nSome rods may have Damping Devices (springs or elastic bands) which help to restrain the washer tub from moving sideways. They are attached to the damper rod and the washer tub near the top. These can break or stretch and become loose. They should have some tension on them when in place. If they are defective (loose or broken), replace them as a set.\nMany (most) rods can be removed from the top of the machine but there are a few which require you to unhook them from the top, and then tip the machine to remove the rod from the bottom. On machines with rods that can be removed from the top, there will be slots in the brackets on the sides of the tub so the rod can go through the slot to be removed.\nWhen replacing the rods, do one rod at a time, otherwise, the weight of the tub and motor assembly can be difficult to lift in order to install the new rod in place.\nHere is a link to a\nvideo with more explanation on Suspension Rods\nShock Absorbers (Front Load Washers)\nMost front-load washers have shock absorbers to steady the washing drum. The drum is usually suspended by large springs from the machine frame and the shock absorbers provide additional support and steadying so the drum doesn't bounce around. When they fail the machine will often vibrate heavily.\nA quick check involves giving the washer drum a downward shove and seeing if it bounces more than once. A more involved check requires removing the front and rear panels of the machine.\nRemove the front and rear panels of the washing machine. You will be able to see the shock absorbers. There are usually 4, sometimes only two, and occasionally three.\nCheck to see if any of them are leaking oil.\nA good check for such leakage is to rub the shiny shaft of the shock absorber with a clean paper towel and note if any oil soaks into the towel.\nAny leakage is a sure sign of failure, and if you find any replace all of the shocks.\nA further test is to detach one end of the shock absorber from the base of the machine and push the plunger in and out by hand. There should be considerable resistance in both directions.\nFor any failure of this test, replace all of the shocks\nIf the shocks look good go on to the next item\nHall Effect Sensor\nWhen it fails, this component makes the machine run \"blind\" because it doesn't know where the rotor position is. Consequently, it can't accurately sense the load size, and it often also causes vibration issues which will trigger the UE code.\nThis is a relatively inexpensive part, and the equipment to test it will cost almost as much as the part. So if you have reached this point and don't have access to a multimeter, you might consider just buying the part.\nThe preliminary procedure to test the Hall effect sensor is simple. You are looking for a resistance of between 5,000-15,000 Ω (10,000Ω is a good value) between the common terminal (on the connector, the terminal closest to one end of the part) and each of the two terminals right next to each other at the opposite end of the connector.\nThe two terminals will have holes that are rounded at two corners (the only two like that), while the common terminal will be square.  This test will tell you if the sensor should be tested with a voltage source.\nTo test the sensor you need to remove it from the machine, which will involve disassembling the motor and removing the stator (the unit with all the motor coils) from the machine.\nTest the sensor with a multimeter as described above\nIf the resistance value is wrong, the sensor is bad, no need to confirm.\nIf the resistance is correct, the sensor may still be bad, and the test requires more equipment.\nHere is a more detailed explanation\n.\nHere is a video with a very quick test\n.\nThere is a more complete and accurate test that requires a fair amount of skill with a multimeter and also requires a power supply. A\nlink is included below\n.\nDrum Support Spider\nThis is an essentially\nfatal\n(you will have to almost completely disassemble your machine and the replacement part is costly) condition which happens mainly to front loaders  and causes uE errors. It seems to be connected to water pH conditions because very alkaline water (high pH) more readily corrodes aluminum. High-alkali detergents don't help. Washing soda (Sodium carbonate) will produce a mild sodium hydroxide solution (alkali) when dissolved in water.\nThe spider is generally made from cast aluminum and the combination of moisture and alkaline conditions can cause massive corrosion because the aluminum is held in contact with the stainless steel drum, so the aluminum corrodes rapidly.\nThis is a failure that can be diagnosed as follows on front loaders.\nOpen the machine and rotate the drum by hand.\nListen for a grinding or thumping noise as it turns. If it is really bad you might hear pieces rattling as it turns.\nFor a further check, it can also help to peel back the door seal so that you can observe the edge of the drum in relation to the edge of the door opening in the front cover.\nRotate the drum and check to see if you notice a wobble in the edge of the drum compared to the edge of the door opening.\nTry to turn the drum so the suspension does not move (try not to press downward when you turn it.)\nA similar method will work for top  loaders. You can observe if the tub rotates with a wobble. If it does wobble, it is a bad sign. You can try rocking the tub to see if you hear grinding or rubbing noises.\nIf the spider seems ok, move on to the next item.\nIf it seems to be a problem, you can disassemble your machine to check. It may not be economically repairable. If you have more time than money you can go after it.\nOther Causes\nDirect Drive Motor Failure\nSome units can experience failure in the direct drive motor, where a magnet on the rotor comes loose, or the rotor is bent. This can cause vibration. Also, look for wiring harness problems (which may show up as an\nLE\nerror)\nBalance Ring\nOften liquid is filled on many top-load machines, if the liquid leaks out the machine will vibrate. Check to see that the liquid is still present. Some front-load machines use concrete weights that can crack and shed pieces. Check to see that they are intact and that there is no debris under or inside the machine.\nTub Bearings\nBoth top loaders and front loaders can suffer from vibration if the bearings that support the washing tub or drum are failing. This is more prevalent with ball bearings, as water intrusion or wear will create substantial vibration. Another difficult repair but if you have more time than money the parts are available. The unit will likely sound like a freight train on spin\nDrive Block\nThe drive block is a part that drives the agitator on top load machines. It is located inside the wash tub and can be accessed by removing the agitator. When it is worn, it can lead to vibration of the machine when spinning because the agitator will rattle.\nAdditional Information\nHall Effect sensor complete test video link\n2其他贡献者\nBill Gilbert\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n0条评论"

电子废弃物回收法律及回收点名单\n新西兰电子废弃物回收点\nTechCollect NZ 提供了一个\n电子废弃物回收点查找器\n。\nEwaste.org.nz 在 Auckland 定期举办\n回收活动\n。\n新西兰电子废弃物回收法规\n新西兰政府于2020年7月开始\n要求对电子产品进行产品责任管理\n，从而引入生产者对电子废弃物进行回收的要求。\n新西兰\n遵守《巴塞尔公约》\n对电子废弃物的进口进行管理。\n有趣的知识：在 Auckland 的 Mint Innovation，\n微生物可以将电子废弃物中的金提取出来\n，无需使用砷化物的有害步骤。\n印度 - 电子废弃物回收法律及回收点名单\n印度是继中国和美国之后，全球第三大电子废弃物产生国。然而，印度非但没有对电子废弃物进行立法管理，反而从其他国家大量进口，\n送至例如 Seelampur 的地下回收中心\n。\nSeelampur 展示了当前电子废弃物回收计划存在的问题：\n印度国内95%的电子废弃物\n采用不正规的方式，使用非法劳力进行分拣。 Seelampur 的经济极度依赖电子废弃物的处理，尽管造成的污染使得天空呈现灰色，工人时常因为呼吸系统疾病而丧命，但当地居民仍然不愿意打破现状。印度政府需要平衡现代化回收工厂带来的好处，以及不正规回收分拣工作对当地居民收入的重要性。理想情况下，政府应该寻找一种循序渐进的方案，引导目前从事不正规分拣工作的人到正规回收工厂中工作。\n目前，印度有许多正规的电子废弃物回收点（在下面列出）。2022年2月，德里政府宣布将在 Narela 工业园区建立\n去哪过第一个电子废弃物回收园区\n。\n印度电子废弃物回收点\nData Direct Networks 维护着一份\n印度全国电子废弃物回收点\n名单。\nActalent Services 也有一份\n印度全国电子废弃物回收点\n名单。\nDell 也有一份\n印度全国电子废弃物回收点\n名单。\n印度电子废弃物回收法规\n在2016年，依据 E-Waste Management Rules，印度要求\n产生电子废弃物的企业必须对其进行回收\n，意味着电子废弃物回收点必须向政府登记，生产电子废弃物的厂家必须向进行废品回收的顾客支付押金（含利息）。截止2023年，来自企业的电子废弃物至少有70%应当被送往回收点或拆解中心。\n亚洲 - 电子废弃物回收法律及回收点名单\n根据\n联合国\n，\n随着收入的增加，亚洲消费者开始更加频繁的更换手上的电子产品。除此之外，越来越多的产品追求低成本、低售价，在设计时忽略可维修性、可翻新性，以及可回收性。\n亚洲所有国家均依照《巴塞尔公约》或国内的法律框架对电子废弃物进行控制。然而，不同国家对于二手电子产品和电子废弃物的进口管控策略却有所不同。大致分为两类：1）控制电子废弃物的进口，但不限制二手电子商品的进口，台湾，日本，菲律宾，韩国，新加坡，越南在此之列；2）完全禁止电子废弃物进口，禁止或限制二手电子商品的进口，柬埔寨，中国，马来西亚，越南，香港在此之列。\n从2012年至2017年，东亚和东南亚的电子废弃物\n增加了63%\n。\n尽管采取了这些正式措施，全球各国的执法部门仍面临诸多挑战。\n如要了解更多信息，请访问\nRegional E-Waste-Monitor\n。\n柬埔寨\n柬埔寨1999年的 Solid Waste Management e-waste Sub-decree\n禁止电子废弃物进口\n。尽管没有全国性的电子废弃物管理方案，部分地方政府提出了地方性解决方案:例如， Phnom Penh Municipality 于2009年开始\n电子废弃物管理计划\n。\n电池投放垃圾桶\n设立在 Phnom Penh 的许多商场内，包括 the Sorya Shopping Mall, Plaza, Lucky Supermarkets, Exchange Square Eden Garden, Olympia, Stung Meanchey Thmey, TK and the Marts at Total, Tela gas stations, Chip Mong NORO Mall, Chip Mong Bak Touk, Borey Peng Huoth Boeung Snor, PTT Gas Station & Cafe Amazon near Olympic Stadium, Star Mart at the Bokor traffic light, and at Phsar Toch。\n中国\n为保护环境，中国政府\n于2008年通过了电子废弃物回收管理办法，并于2011年正式实施\n。中国曾接收全球70%的电子废弃物，但2018年开始实行更加严格的\n进口物品禁令\n，其中包括电子废弃物。\n贵屿镇曾是全球最差的电子废弃物回收地。\n2012年\n，数千家非正规回收商在贵屿镇处理了超过一百万吨电子废弃物。大多数工人纯手工进行分拣，对环境及自身健康均造成严重危害。2015年，贵屿循环经济工业园建成，旨在取代所有的非正规回收商。\n如要查找中国境内的电子废弃物回收点，请使用\nBaidu Recycle\n合作开发\n。\n日本\n环境省官方网站列出不同居住区域的地区性回收规定：\nPortal Site for Recycling Compact-Appliances\n（链接已失效）\n如要对家用电器进行回收，请参阅以下网站，查看所在区域的地方性回收规定，以及对正确回收方式的介绍：\nMinistry of Environment Region Map\n马来西亚\nCode SW110\n, the Environmental Quality Regulations of 2005。政府于2018年宣布\n禁止一切不可回收固体废弃物的进口\n。\nThe E-Waste Management in Malaysia program of the Department of Environment 提供了\n电子废弃物回收点检索器\n。\n菲律宾\nGlobe Philippines 提供一个\n菲律宾全国电子废弃物回收服务检索名单\n。\n韩国\n韩国没有全国性的电子废弃物管理法规，部分地方政府启动了区域性的电子废弃物回收计划。\n自2009年起，首尔特别市政府启动了名为城市矿山的项目，目的是从各区域的办公室及公共设施回收丢弃的电子废弃物，再从中提取稀土材料。更多信息可点击\nSeoul Resource Center\n了解。\n韩国环境部\n此网站\n提供如何使用该项服务的介绍：“废弃的大型家用电器（例如洗衣机，冰箱，空调）：请使用免费上门回收服务。☎ 致电预约(1599-0903)或在线预约(www.15990903.or.kr)“，对于小型电器：”可以投放至所在社区的服务中心或公寓楼内的特殊回收箱内“。\nThe Korea Electronics Recycling Cooperative (KERC)是专为促进有效回收电子电器（WEEE）而设立的，同时负责运营全国性的回收中心。\n点此查看韩国境内的回收点位置，以及可回收容量\n。\nLG Electronics 遵循韩国及世界各地的 WEEE 回收法规，对电子废弃物进行回收。\n点此查看 LG 电子对于回收商的规定\n泰国\n泰国于2020年依据《巴塞尔公约》规定\n禁止所有电子废弃物的进口\n。泰国境内的环保运动\n要求政府\n采取更严格的进口管制措施，同时更加仔细的检查进口货柜。\nE-waste Green Network 提供一份\n泰国境内电子废弃物回收点\n名单。\n台灣\n台灣於1986年制訂\n毒性及關注化學物質管理法\n，並於2019年再次修訂。該法案要求電子廢棄物中多種關鍵零部件需要在政府許可的機構按照政府規定程序進行處置。\n台灣施行的「四合一回收制度」\n推動全國的電子廢棄物管理制度發展\n，從1997年沒有正式的電子廢棄物回收，到2011年的19座回收設施。時至今日，台灣是全球回收率最高的國家，\n一些報導表明\n55%的家庭廢棄物得到妥善回收。\n在\n台北市\n，電池及多種小型電器（例如手機，電腦，及各類外接設備）通過每週多次駛過的\n回收卡車進行收集\n。\n有趣的知識：位於桃園市的佳龍科技工程公司，使用部分回收的電子廢棄物\n建造了電子廢棄物回收設施\n。\n拉丁美洲 - 电子废弃物回收法律及回收点名单\n拉丁美洲国家对于电子废弃物的管理还处于起步阶段。可惜的是，目前没有任何一个拉丁美洲国家的电子废弃物年回收率超过5%。只有少数国家制定了电子废弃物管理法规。\nhttps://www.unido.org/cooperacion-region...\nhttp://www.periodicodelbiencomun.com/vid...\n阿根廷\nhttp://reciclandotodo.com.ar/\nhttps://www.centrobasuracero.org/home.ph...\n玻利维亚\nSanta Cruz, Bolivia 地区的\n回收点地图\n（确保选择 \"Puntos RAEE Fijos\"）。\n玻利维亚政府提供\nResiduos Electronicos project 的网页。\nREEcicla\nKiosco Verde\n巴西\n巴西是拉丁美洲产生电子废弃物数量第一的国家（在整个美洲大陆排名第二），政府于2010年通过全国性固体废弃物法规，\"Política Nacional de Resíduos Sólidos\"。该法规明确了管理原则，目标，以及对固体废弃物管理的具体手段。（联邦地区、各个联邦州以及市政当局必须于联盟合作，使得法规内容得以实施）：\nhttp://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_at...\n.\n根据 Global E-Waste Monitor 2017 ，巴西产生了150万吨的电子废弃物，只有3%得到妥善回收。\n巴西国内有废弃物回收公司，以及非营利组织负责的废弃物分拣机构，对电子废弃物提供回收服务。下面列举少数几个：\neCycle\nGreen Eletron\necobraz\nCoopermiti\ne-lixo RJ\ndescarte certo\n智利\nhttp://www.recycla.cl/\nhttps://www.debaja.cl/\n哥伦比亚\nhttp://www.puntosverdeslito.com/\nhttps://ecocomputo.com/\n哥斯达黎加\nhttp://www.solirsa.com/\n厄瓜多尔\nhttp://vertmonde.com/index.html\nhttp://www.reciclametal.com/index.php/se...\n墨西哥\nhttps://reciclaelectronicos.com/\nhttps://mxcity.mx/2014/12/no-sabes-que-h...\n秘鲁\nhttp://www.minam.gob.pe/calidadambiental...\n乌拉圭\nhttps://www.werbasa.com/es/reciclaje-res...\n中东地区 -

You can take a shot at blowing stuff out, It is probably the switch on the control panel board that is failing. especially if you don't have trouble with any of the other control buttons. So you might want to start by blowing out the start switch if you have a source of compressed air. While you handle these parts especially blowing air on them, make sure to handle them by the edges, and keep yourself grounded or at least touching something that is grounded frequently. Since the boards are encapsulated (note the honey colored material covering the board) to protect against corrosion, replacing components becomes a chore. So your next step will probably be a replacement control panel board if the cleaning doesn't help. There are services that will repair the board as well; haven't looked into relative cost. You can fix it, and that's a lot better than having to spend for another appliance.\nBill Gilbert\n-\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-159056\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/159056/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-159056\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/159056\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n预览"
