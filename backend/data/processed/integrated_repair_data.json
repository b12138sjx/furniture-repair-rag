Leave this pick inserted in the top-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 11 Heat the top edge and corner Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the top edge and top-right corner of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 12 Separate the top adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Insert a third opening pick into the top-left corner. Slide the opening pick along the top edge and around the top-right corner, stopping above the volume up button . Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 13 Heat the right edge Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the right edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 14 Separate the right adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Insert a fourth opening pick into the bottom-right corner. Slide the opening pick around the corner and up the right edge, stopping below the volume down button . Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 15 Reposition the back glass At this point, the back glass should be free from the frame. If the back glass feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick to check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Remove the 5G mmWave antenna Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the 5G mmWave antenna connector. 步骤 24 The 5G mmWave antenna is attached with a small piece of stretch-release adhesive. Use tweezers to carefully peel up the antenna's black adhesive pull tab. 步骤 25 Use tweezers to firmly grasp the adhesive pull tab and pull at a shallow angle. If the adhesive breaks, try to grip the broken end with tweezers and continue pulling. If you're unable to pull the adhesive out in one piece, apply a drop of high concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol under the antenna and move to the next step. 步骤 26 Use the point of a spudger to pry up and remove the 5G mmWave antenna. 步骤 27 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 28 Install the mmWave antenna Use tweezers or a spudger to remove any adhesive residue from the top of the earpiece speaker and back of the antenna. If your replacement part doesn't include new adhesive, use a small strip of double-sided tape to secure the antenna to the earpiece speaker. 步骤 29 Align the mmWave antenna over the earpiece speaker. Make sure the antenna's connector reaches its logic board socket. Press the antenna onto the earpiece speaker to secure it. 步骤 30 Use your finger or a spudger to press the antenna connector onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 31 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 32 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 33 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 34 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 35 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 36 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 37 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 38 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 39 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 40 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 41 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 42 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 43 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 44 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 45 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 46 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 47 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 48 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 49 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 50 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 51 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 52 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 53 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

      "content": "iPhone 16 Pro Max Front Camera Assembly Replacement 简介 Use this guide to replace the front camera assembly in your iPhone 16 Pro Max. This assembly includes the front-facing camera and Face ID hardware. If your front-facing photos come out fuzzy, noisy, or your camera has trouble focusing, it might need to be replaced. You'll need replacement back glass adhesive to complete this repair. After your repair, calibrate authentic Apple front cameras using Repair Assistant . 你所需要的 步骤 1 Before you begin Allow your iPhone's battery to drain below 25%, as a charged lithium-ion battery is a potential safety hazard. Unplug any cables from your iPhone. Hold the power and either volume buttons, and slide to power off your iPhone. 步骤 2 Tape over any cracks If your screen or back glass is badly cracked, lay overlapping strips of packing tape over the glass to protect yourself and make disassembly easier. Make sure there's a smooth area near the bottom edge that's big enough for a suction cup to stick to. 步骤 3 Remove the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to remove the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 步骤 4 Mark your opening picks If inserted too far, an opening pick can damage your device. Follow this step to mark your pick and prevent damage. Measure 3 mm from the tip and mark the opening pick with a permanent marker. You can also mark the other corners of the pick with different measurements. Alternatively, tape a coin to a pick 3 mm from the tip. 20条评论 步骤 5 Create a gap using a suction handle 在这个步骤中使用的工具： iOpener $14.99 购买 The next two steps show how to create an initial gap using a suction handle. Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the bottom edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. You can also use an iOpener to heat the back glass. Follow these instructions to heat and apply the iOpener properly. 步骤 6 Apply a suction handle to the bottom edge of the back glass. Pull up on the handle with strong, steady force to create a gap between the back glass and the frame. If a gap doesn't appear, apply more heat to the edge and try again. Insert the tip of an opening pick into the gap. 步骤 7 Back glass information As you slice the adhesive securing the back glass in the following steps, don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the following areas: A delicate cable connecting the back glass to the iPhone, right next to the volume up button. Don't insert your pick here to avoid slicing the cable. Multiple spring contacts around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 8 Separate the bottom edge adhesive Slide the opening pick along the bottom edge to slice the adhesive. If the adhesive feels difficult to slice, reheat the edge for a minute and try again. Leave the opening pick in the bottom-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 9 Heat the left edge Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the left edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 10 Separate the left adhesive Insert a second opening pick into the bottom-left corner, close to the existing pick. Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Slide your pick along the left edge to separate the adhesive and release the metal clips. You'll hear and feel the metal clips release as you pass them. Leave this pick inserted in the top-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 11 Heat the top edge and corner Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the top edge and top-right corner of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 12 Separate the top adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Insert a third opening pick into the top-left corner. Slide the opening pick along the top edge and around the top-right corner, stopping above the volume up button . Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 13 Heat the right edge Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the right edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 14 Separate the right adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Insert a fourth opening pick into the bottom-right corner. Slide the opening pick around the corner and up the right edge, stopping below the volume down button . Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 15 Reposition the back glass At this point, the back glass should be free from the frame. If the back glass feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick to check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Remove the front camera assembly Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the earpiece speaker and 5G mmWave antenna connectors. 步骤 24 Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the two front camera assembly connectors underneath the previous connectors. 步骤 25 Pry up and remove the front camera assembly. 步骤 26 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 27 Install the front camera assembly Lay the front camera assembly in its recess. Gently tuck the camera flex cables into the gap between the rear camera assembly and the earpiece speaker assembly. 步骤 28 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the two camera connectors onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 29 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the earpiece speaker and the mmWave antenna connectors onto the logic board. 步骤 30 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 31 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 32 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 33 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 34 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 35 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 36 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 37 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 38 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 39 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 40 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 41 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 42 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 43 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 44 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 45 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 46 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 47 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 48 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 49 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 50 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 51 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 52 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, calibrate a genuine replacement part using Apple's Repair Assistant .

Make sure the bottom edge of the cover latches properly to the frame. 步骤 60 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the three screws securing the Taptic Engine cover: One 2.9 mm‑long screw One 1.3 mm‑long screw One 2.4 mm‑long screw 步骤 61 Use your finger or a spudger to press the assembly cable connector onto the logic board. 步骤 62 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 63 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 64 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 65 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 66 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 67 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 68 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 69 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 70 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 71 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 72 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 73 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 74 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 75 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 76 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 77 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 78 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 79 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 80 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 81 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 82 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 83 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 84 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

Insert a fourth opening pick into the bottom-right corner. Slide the opening pick around the corner and up the right edge, stopping below the volume down button . Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 15 Reposition the back glass At this point, the back glass should be free from the frame. If the back glass feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick to check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Remove the 5G mmWave antenna Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the 5G mmWave antenna connector. 步骤 24 The 5G mmWave antenna is attached with a small piece of stretch-release adhesive. Use tweezers to carefully peel up the antenna's black adhesive pull tab. 步骤 25 Use tweezers to firmly grasp the adhesive pull tab and pull at a shallow angle. If the adhesive breaks, try to grip the broken end with tweezers and continue pulling. If you're unable to pull the adhesive out in one piece, apply a drop of high concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol under the antenna and move to the next step. 步骤 26 Use the point of a spudger to pry up and remove the 5G mmWave antenna. 步骤 27 Remove the earpiece speaker Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the earpiece speaker connector. 步骤 28 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Standoff Screwdriver for iPhones $5.49 购买 Remove the six screws securing the earpiece speaker: One 2.4 mm‑long Phillips screw Three 1.3 mm‑long Phillips screws One 1.6 mm‑long Phillips screw One 3.3 mm‑long standoff screw Standoff screws are best removed using a dedicated standoff driver or driver bit. In a pinch, a small flathead screwdriver will do the job—but use extra caution to ensure it doesn't slip and damage surrounding components. 步骤 29 Use tweezers to lift and remove the earpiece speaker. You may feel some resistance near the top edge, where the speaker gasket seals against the frame. Pull the speaker out gently to release the seal. 步骤 30 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 31 Install the earpiece speaker Align the top edge of the earpiece speaker with the top edge of the frame Lay the earpiece speaker into its recess. You may need to push the speaker upwards towards the top edge of the frame in order to get it to seat properly. 步骤 32 Install the six screws securing the earpiece speaker: One 2.4 mm‑long Phillips screw Three 1.3 mm‑long Phillips screws One 1.6 mm‑long Phillips screw One 3.3 mm‑long standoff screw 步骤 33 Use your finger or a spudger to press the earpiece speaker connector onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 34 Install the mmWave antenna Use tweezers or a spudger to remove any adhesive residue from the top of the earpiece speaker and back of the antenna. If your replacement part doesn't include new adhesive, use a small strip of double-sided tape to secure the antenna to the earpiece speaker. 步骤 35 Align the mmWave antenna over the earpiece speaker. Make sure the antenna's connector reaches its logic board socket. Press the antenna onto the earpiece speaker to secure it. 步骤 36 Use your finger or a spudger to press the antenna connector onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 37 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 38 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 39 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 40 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 41 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 42 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 43 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 44 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 45 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 46 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 47 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 48 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 49 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 50 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 51 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 52 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 53 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive.

Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 57 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 58 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 59 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 60 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 61 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 62 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 63 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 64 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 65 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 66 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 67 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 68 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 69 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 70 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Remove the LiDAR sensor Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the LiDAR sensor connector. 步骤 24 Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the two screws securing the LiDAR sensor: One 1.6 mm‑long screw One 2.9 mm‑long screw 步骤 25 Use your fingers or tweezers to lift and remove the LiDAR sensor. 步骤 26 Remove the rear camera assembly Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the first rear camera connector. Disconnect the second camera connector underneath the first connector. 步骤 27 Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the two 2.9 mm‑long screws securing the rear camera assembly. 步骤 28 Be careful not to touch any of the camera lens. If you do, carefully wipe the lens with a lint-free cloth. Insert the tip of a spudger under the top edge of the rear camera assembly. Pry up the assembly to loosen it from the frame. Remove the rear camera assembly. 步骤 29 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 30 Install the rear camera assembly Lay the rear camera assembly in its recess. 步骤 31 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the two 2.9 mm‑long screws securing the rear camera assembly. 步骤 32 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the two camera connectors onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 33 Install the LiDAR sensor Lay the LiDAR sensor in its recess. 步骤 34 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the two screws securing the LiDAR sensor: One 1.6 mm‑long screw One 2.9 mm‑long screw 步骤 35 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the LiDAR sensor connector to the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 36 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 37 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 38 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 39 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 40 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 41 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 42 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 43 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 44 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 45 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 46 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 47 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board.

Is it true that viewing with a magnifying glass under the light of the house ruins the screen? On the iPhone 16 Pro Max Ss Vv - That's a good question! I would say that under normal house lights, you're very unlikely to damage the screen with a magnifying glass. I haven't tried it, but it's theoretically possible to damage the screen with a magnifying glass if you're in direct sunlight. Arthur Shi - Hello, if we put a thin paper into the groove between the screen and the iPhone frame and pull it left and right. Does the waterproof glue get damaged? I did this out of curiosity. I'm a little worried that I may have damaged the device.

Be careful not to pry against the battery. Remove the Taptic Engine. 步骤 34 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 35 Install the Taptic Engine Lay the Taptic Engine in its recess. 步骤 36 Use your finger to pivot the corner bracket down into place. 步骤 37 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the 2.1 mm‑long screw securing the Taptic Engine. 步骤 38 Use your finger to gently press the lower assembly cable onto the top of the Taptic Engine. 步骤 39 Install the two screws securing the lower assembly cable: One 1.0 mm‑long tri-point Y000 screw One 1.3 mm‑long Phillips screw 步骤 40 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the two lower assembly cable connectors. 步骤 41 Lay the Taptic Engine cover in place and align it by its screw holes. Make sure the bottom edge of the cover latches properly to the frame. 步骤 42 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the three screws securing the Taptic Engine cover: One 2.9 mm‑long screw One 1.3 mm‑long screw One 2.4 mm‑long screw 步骤 43 Use your finger or a spudger to press the assembly cable connector onto the logic board. 步骤 44 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 45 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 46 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 47 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 48 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 49 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 50 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 51 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 52 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 53 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 54 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 55 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 56 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 57 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 58 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 59 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 60 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 61 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 62 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 63 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 64 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 65 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 66 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the bottom edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. You can also use an iOpener to heat the back glass. Follow these instructions to heat and apply the iOpener properly. 步骤 6 Apply a suction handle to the bottom edge of the back glass. Pull up on the handle with strong, steady force to create a gap between the back glass and the frame. If a gap doesn't appear, apply more heat to the edge and try again. Insert the tip of an opening pick into the gap. 步骤 7 Back glass information As you slice the adhesive securing the back glass in the following steps, don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the following areas: A delicate cable connecting the back glass to the iPhone, right next to the volume up button. Don't insert your pick here to avoid slicing the cable. Multiple spring contacts around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 8 Separate the bottom edge adhesive Slide the opening pick along the bottom edge to slice the adhesive. If the adhesive feels difficult to slice, reheat the edge for a minute and try again. Leave the opening pick in the bottom-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 9 Heat the left edge Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the left edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 10 Separate the left adhesive Insert a second opening pick into the bottom-left corner, close to the existing pick. Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Slide your pick along the left edge to separate the adhesive and release the metal clips. You'll hear and feel the metal clips release as you pass them. Leave this pick inserted in the top-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 11 Heat the top edge and corner Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the top edge and top-right corner of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 12 Separate the top adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts.

Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 13 Heat the right edge Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the right edge of the back glass until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 14 Separate the right adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. Insert a fourth opening pick into the bottom-right corner. Slide the opening pick around the corner and up the right edge, stopping below the volume down button . Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 15 Reposition the back glass At this point, the back glass should be free from the frame. If the back glass feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick to check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 24 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 25 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 26 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 27 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 28 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 29 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 30 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 31 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 32 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 33 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 34 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 35 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 36 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 37 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 38 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 39 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 40 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 41 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 42 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 43 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 44 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 45 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 46 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, calibrate a genuine replacement part using Apple's Repair Assistant .

Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 62 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 63 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 64 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 65 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 66 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 67 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 68 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 69 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 70 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 71 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 72 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 73 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 74 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 75 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 76 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 77 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 78 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 79 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 80 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 81 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, run Apple's Repair Assistant .

Don't pry against the battery, or you may damage it. You'll feel some resistance as the microphone releases from its adhesive gasket. Remove the bottom microphone. 步骤 36 Remove the adhesive gasket Use tweezers or your fingers to remove the old adhesive gasket from the bottom of the frame. 步骤 37 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 38 Install the bottom microphone Peel the white liner from the microphone adhesive gasket Align the gasket to the frame's microphone cutout and use a spudger to press it in place. Remove the remaining liner from the adhesive. 步骤 39 Insert the microphone at a downward angle into its recess before pressing it flat to the frame. 步骤 40 Install the three screws securing the bottom microphone: One 3.4 mm‑long standoff screw One 3 mm‑long standoff screw One 1.4 mm‑long tri-point Y000 screw 步骤 41 Install the Taptic Engine Lay the Taptic Engine in its recess. 步骤 42 Use your finger to pivot the corner bracket down into place. 步骤 43 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the 2.1 mm‑long screw securing the Taptic Engine. 步骤 44 Use your finger to gently press the lower assembly cable onto the top of the Taptic Engine. 步骤 45 Install the two screws securing the lower assembly cable: One 1.0 mm‑long tri-point Y000 screw One 1.3 mm‑long Phillips screw 步骤 46 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the two lower assembly cable connectors. 步骤 47 Lay the Taptic Engine cover in place and align it by its screw holes. Make sure the bottom edge of the cover latches properly to the frame. 步骤 48 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the three screws securing the Taptic Engine cover: One 2.9 mm‑long screw One 1.3 mm‑long screw One 2.4 mm‑long screw 步骤 49 Use your finger or a spudger to press the assembly cable connector onto the logic board. 步骤 50 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 51 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 52 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 53 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 54 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 55 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 56 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 57 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 58 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 59 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 60 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 61 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 62 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 63 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 64 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 65 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 66 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 67 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 68 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 69 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 70 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 71 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 72 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 69 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 70 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 71 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 72 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 73 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 74 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 75 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 76 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 77 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 78 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 79 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 80 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 81 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 82 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 83 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 84 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 15 Reposition the back glass At this point, the back glass should be free from the frame. If the back glass feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick to check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Remove the 5G mmWave antenna Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the 5G mmWave antenna connector. 步骤 24 The 5G mmWave antenna is attached with a small piece of stretch-release adhesive. Use tweezers to carefully peel up the antenna's black adhesive pull tab. 步骤 25 Use tweezers to firmly grasp the adhesive pull tab and pull at a shallow angle. If the adhesive breaks, try to grip the broken end with tweezers and continue pulling. If you're unable to pull the adhesive out in one piece, apply a drop of high concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol under the antenna and move to the next step. 步骤 26 Use the point of a spudger to pry up and remove the 5G mmWave antenna. 步骤 27 Remove the earpiece speaker Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the earpiece speaker connector. 步骤 28 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Standoff Screwdriver for iPhones $5.49 购买 Remove the six screws securing the earpiece speaker: One 2.4 mm‑long Phillips screw Three 1.3 mm‑long Phillips screws One 1.6 mm‑long Phillips screw One 3.3 mm‑long standoff screw Standoff screws are best removed using a dedicated standoff driver or driver bit. In a pinch, a small flathead screwdriver will do the job—but use extra caution to ensure it doesn't slip and damage surrounding components. 步骤 29 Use tweezers to lift and remove the earpiece speaker. You may feel some resistance near the top edge, where the speaker gasket seals against the frame. Pull the speaker out gently to release the seal. 步骤 30 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 31 Install the earpiece speaker Align the top edge of the earpiece speaker with the top edge of the frame Lay the earpiece speaker into its recess. You may need to push the speaker upwards towards the top edge of the frame in order to get it to seat properly. 步骤 32 Install the six screws securing the earpiece speaker: One 2.4 mm‑long Phillips screw Three 1.3 mm‑long Phillips screws One 1.6 mm‑long Phillips screw One 3.3 mm‑long standoff screw 步骤 33 Use your finger or a spudger to press the earpiece speaker connector onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 34 Install the mmWave antenna Use tweezers or a spudger to remove any adhesive residue from the top of the earpiece speaker and back of the antenna. If your replacement part doesn't include new adhesive, use a small strip of double-sided tape to secure the antenna to the earpiece speaker. 步骤 35 Align the mmWave antenna over the earpiece speaker. Make sure the antenna's connector reaches its logic board socket. Press the antenna onto the earpiece speaker to secure it. 步骤 36 Use your finger or a spudger to press the antenna connector onto the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 37 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 38 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 39 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 40 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 41 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 42 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 43 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 44 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.

If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 42 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 43 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 44 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 45 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 46 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 47 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 48 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 49 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 50 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 51 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 52 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, calibrate a genuine replacement part using Apple's Repair Assistant .

Leave this pick inserted to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 15 Reposition the back glass At this point, the back glass should be free from the frame. If the back glass feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick to check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Swing open the back glass to the right of the iPhone to separate the remaining adhesive. Support the back glass with a clean, sturdy object. 步骤 16 Remove the battery connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 17 Lift and remove the battery connector cover. 步骤 18 Disconnect the battery Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the battery press connector. 步骤 19 Remove the back glass connector cover Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 20 Lift the back glass connector cover straight up and remove it. 步骤 21 Remove the back glass Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the back glass connector. 步骤 22 Remove the back glass. 步骤 23 Remove the LiDAR sensor Use the point of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the LiDAR sensor connector. 步骤 24 Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the two screws securing the LiDAR sensor: One 1.6 mm‑long screw One 2.9 mm‑long screw 步骤 25 Use your fingers or tweezers to lift and remove the LiDAR sensor. 步骤 26 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 27 Install the LiDAR sensor Lay the LiDAR sensor in its recess. 步骤 28 Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the two screws securing the LiDAR sensor: One 1.6 mm‑long screw One 2.9 mm‑long screw 步骤 29 Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the LiDAR sensor connector to the logic board. To re-attach press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. 步骤 30 Remove the leftover adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 31 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 32 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 33 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 34 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 35 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 36 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 37 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 38 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 39 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 40 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 41 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board.

If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 55 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 56 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 57 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 58 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 59 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 60 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 61 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 62 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 63 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 64 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 65 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, calibrate genuine replacement parts using Apple's Repair Assistant .

If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Use blunt nose tweezers or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter. Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame. If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a hair dryer or heat gun and try again. 步骤 49 Clean the back glass 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Microfiber Cleaning Cloths $3.99 购买 If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a microfiber or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive. 步骤 50 Clean the frame Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it. Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 51 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 52 Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 53 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame. 步骤 54 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 55 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 56 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 57 Connect the back glass Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone. 步骤 58 Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board. 步骤 59 Connect the battery Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board. This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly.

If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 48 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 49 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 50 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 51 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 52 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 53 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 54 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 55 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 56 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 57 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 58 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, calibrate a genuine replacement rear camera assembly using Apple's Repair Assistant .

      "content": "iPhone 16 Pro Max Screen Replacement 简介 Use this guide to replace a broken, cracked, or non‑responsive screen in your iPhone 16 Pro Max. You'll need replacement screen adhesive to complete this repair. Note : Since you can't disconnect the battery during this repair, be especially careful not to use metal prying tools or touch any exposed contacts in your iPhone. After your repair, calibrate an authentic screen using Apple's Repair Assistant . 你所需要的 步骤 1 Before you begin Allow your iPhone's battery to drain below 25%, as a charged lithium-ion battery is a potential safety hazard. Unplug any cables from your iPhone. Hold the power and either volume buttons, and slide to power off your iPhone. 步骤 2 Tape over any cracks If your screen or back glass is badly cracked, lay overlapping strips of packing tape over the glass to protect yourself and make disassembly easier. Make sure there's a smooth area near the bottom edge that's big enough for a suction cup to stick to. 步骤 3 Remove the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to remove the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 步骤 4 Mark your opening picks If inserted too far, an opening pick can damage your device. Follow this step to mark your pick and prevent damage. Measure 3 mm from the tip and mark the opening pick with a permanent marker. You can also mark the other corners of the pick with different measurements. Alternatively, tape a coin to a pick 3 mm from the tip. 20条评论 步骤 5 Create a gap with a suction handle 在这个步骤中使用的工具： iOpener $14.99 购买 The next two steps show how to create an initial gap using a suction handle. Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the bottom edge of the screen until it's hot to the touch. You can also use an iOpener to heat the screen. Follow these instructions to heat and apply the iOpener properly. 步骤 6 Apply a suction handle to the bottom edge of the screen. While supporting the frame with one hand, pull up on the handle with a strong, steady force to create a gap between the screen and the frame. If you can't create a gap, apply more heat to the edge and try again. Insert the tip of an opening pick into the gap. 步骤 7 Screen information As you slice the adhesive securing the screen in the following steps, don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the following areas: Two delicate cables connecting the screen to the iPhone—one just above the Action button and the other about halfway along the left edge of the iPhone Multiple spring contacts around the perimeter of the iPhone 步骤 8 Slice the bottom edge adhesive Slide the opening pick along the bottom edge to release the adhesive. Don't insert the pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts. If the adhesive feels difficult to slice, reheat the edge for a minute. Leave the opening pick in the bottom-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 9 Heat the left edge Use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat the left edge of the screen until it's hot to the touch. 步骤 10 Separate the left adhesive Don't insert your pick deeper than 3 mm to avoid damaging the spring contacts and cables. Insert a second opening pick in the bottom-left corner, close to the existing pick. Slide the opening pick along the left edge of the screen to separate the adhesive and release the metal clips. You'll hear and feel the metal clips release as you pass them. Leave the opening pick in the top-left corner to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 11 Separate the remaining adhesives Repeat the heating and slicing procedure along the remaining screen edges. 步骤 12 Swing open the screen At this point, the screen should be free from the frame. If the screen feels stuck, go back around the perimeter with your pick and carefully check for missed sections of adhesive or stuck clips. Carefully lift the screen upwards until the clips along the long edges clear the frame. Swing open the screen over the left edge of the iPhone and lay it flat on your work surface. 步骤 13 Remove the connector covers Use a tri-point Y000 driver to remove the two 1.3 mm‑long screws securing the front sensor and display connector covers. 步骤 14 Use tweezers to grasp the front sensor connector cover near the screw hole. Lift and remove the cover. Repeat the procedure to remove the display connector cover. 步骤 15 Disconnect the screen Use the tip of a spudger to pry up and disconnect the display press connector . Repeat for the front sensor press connector. 步骤 16 Remove the screen Lift the screen and remove it. 步骤 17 Disassembly complete Congratulations on completing disassembly! The remaining steps will show how to reassemble your iPhone. Depending on your iPhone model, some reassembly photos may have minor visual discrepancies. The procedure, however, will be correct for your iPhone. 步骤 18 Remove the adhesive and its residue Use a spudger or tweezers to remove the adhesive chunks from the iPhone's frame. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. 步骤 19 If you're reinstalling your existing screen, be sure to remove any remaining adhesive from the back of your screen as well. 步骤 20 Using a lint-free cloth (or coffee filter) and some high concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol, clean the areas of the frame and screen where you removed the old adhesive. For best results, swipe your cleaning cloth in one direction, not back and forth. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond. 步骤 21 Apply the replacement adhesive Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation. Use features such as the camera cutout to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame. 步骤 22 Grasp the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose a third of the adhesive. The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame. If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame. 步骤 23 Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of your iPhone's frame. Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive. When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip into place. 步骤 24 Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place. If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place. If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, pull the long edges into alignment with the frame. If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive. If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive. 步骤 25 Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone. Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers. Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive. 步骤 26 Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner—the pull tab is often in a corner of the liner. Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive. At this point, you may still have liners covering the perimeter , which prevent the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet. 步骤 27 Reconnect the screen Use your finger to press down and connect the display connector. To re-attach wide press connectors like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage. Press down and connect the front sensor connector. Align the connector carefully over its socket and press down with your fingertip until it clicks into place. Don't try to force the connector into place. If you're having trouble, reposition it and try again. This is a good time to power on your iPhone and test all functions before you seal it up. Be sure to power your iPhone back down completely before you continue. If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again. 步骤 28 Install the connector covers Tuck the display connector cover's tab into its frame cutout and lay the cover in place. Repeat with the front sensor connector cover. 步骤 29 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the two 1.3 mm‑long screws securing the two connector covers. 步骤 30 Remove the final liners While supporting the screen, use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. Be careful not to touch the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and screen for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 31 Install the screen onto the frame Carefully align the screen's top clips with their frame cutouts. 步骤 32 Lower the screen onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Make sure the screen edge isn't pinching any cables. 步骤 33 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the screen perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 34 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 35 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 36 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 37 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ After your repair, calibrate a genuine replacement screen using Apple's Repair Assistant .

Is it true that viewing with a magnifying glass under the light of the house ruins the screen? On the iPhone 16 Pro Max Ss Vv - That's a good question! I would say that under normal house lights, you're very unlikely to damage the screen with a magnifying glass. I haven't tried it, but it's theoretically possible to damage the screen with a magnifying glass if you're in direct sunlight. Arthur Shi - Hello, if we put a thin paper into the groove between the screen and the iPhone frame and pull it left and right. Does the waterproof glue get damaged? I did this out of curiosity. I'm a little worried that I may have damaged the device.

If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the screen guide to manually connect the display connector. 步骤 43 Install the connector covers Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 44 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws Two 1.0 mm‑long screws 步骤 45 Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place. 步骤 46 Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover: Two 1.3 mm‑long screws One 1.0 mm‑long screw 步骤 47 Remove the final adhesive liners Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive. As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive. Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining. 步骤 48 Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge. If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips. Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame. 步骤 49 Apply heat to the perimeter Use a hair dryer heat gun , or an iOpener to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch. The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond. 步骤 50 Apply pressure to the perimeter Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone. 步骤 51 Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface. Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish. Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions. Alternatively, you can use vise clamps around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive. 步骤 52 Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone. The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable. Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes. The pressure will help activate the adhesive. 步骤 53 Install the pentalobe screws Use a P2 pentalobe driver to install the two 7.4 mm-long screws on either side of the charge port. 即将完成！ Take your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler .

      "content": "iOpener Heating 简介 The iOpener is an insulated, heat-retaining bag that can be heated in a microwave and used to transfer heat to the adhesive along the edge of an iPad or similar device. Follow these basic instructions to get started with your new (black, liquid-filled) iOpener. For the white, solid-filled iOpener, follow this guide instead. For detailed instructions specific to your device and repair, see our set of . 你所需要的 步骤 1 iOpener Heating We recommend that you clean your microwave before proceeding, as any nasty gunk on the bottom may end up stuck to the iOpener. Place the iOpener in the center of the microwave. For carousel microwaves: Make sure the plate spins freely. If your iOpener gets stuck, it may overheat and burn. 35条评论 步骤 2 Heat the iOpener for thirty seconds . Depending on the wattage of your microwave, more or less time may be required. The iOpener is sufficiently heated when it's barely too hot to touch. Throughout the repair procedure, as the iOpener cools, reheat it in the microwave for an additional thirty seconds at a time. Be careful not to overheat the iOpener during the repair. Overheating may cause the iOpener to burst. Do not attempt to heat over 100˚C (212˚F). Never touch the iOpener if it appears swollen. If the iOpener is still too hot in the middle to touch, continue using it while waiting for it to cool down some more before reheating. A properly heated iOpener should stay warm for up to 10 minutes. 30条评论 步骤 3 Remove the iOpener from the microwave, holding it by one of the two flat ends to avoid the hot center. The iOpener will be very hot, so be careful when handling it. Use an oven mitt if necessary. 8条评论 步骤 4 Alternate iOpener heating method If you don't have a microwave, follow this step to heat your iOpener in boiling water. Fill a pot or pan with enough water to fully submerge an iOpener. Heat the water to a boil. Turn off the heat. Place an iOpener into the hot water for 2-3 minutes. Make sure the iOpener is fully submerged in the water. Use tongs to extract the heated iOpener from the hot water. Thoroughly dry the iOpener with a towel. The iOpener will be very hot, so be careful to hold it only by the end tabs. Your iOpener is ready for use! If you need to reheat the iOpener, heat the water to a boil, turn off the heat, and place the iOpener in the water for 2-3 minutes. 10条评论 即将完成！ To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order. 结论 To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order. 你已经完成了！ 取消：我没有完成这个指南。 359等其他人完成本指南。 11其他贡献者 Andrew Optimus Goldheart iFixit iFixit Staff 58指南评论 I do not have a microwave because I think it is unhealthy for food preparation. When I need fastfood I often just eat raw fruit which is much faster, healtier, and tastier than most microwave foods. Does the iOpener Heating also work when it is baked in a frying pan? R de Bruin - Claire Miesch - You are aware thought that there are no proven side effects of microwaving your food though right? A microwave isn’t inherently unhealthy. I think it helps to look at how a microwave works. A microwave oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. While microwave radiation sounds scary its really not. Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation. Non ionizing meaning that it doesn’t make stuff radioactive. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. The water molecules are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other, and so they rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. The friction of the incredibly fast movement heats up the various molecules. Sometimes microwaves are in fact healthier and safer than there counterparts, because the microwave heats food quickly, the nutrients have less time to seep into the water making it more nutrient filled when compared to alternatives. Also, steamed vegetables tend to maintain more nutrients when microwaved than when cooked on a stovetop.

Fry that thing up, lol…gotta put some water down, …but yeah…lmao…too funny dannyhall16 - And much more expensive.

      "content": "Huawei P20 LCD Screen & Digitizer Replacement 简介 Use this guide to replace a broken or defective LCD Screen & Digitizer in your Huawei P20. Note : This guide instructs you to replace only the screen while leaving the original frame and motherboard in place. However, some replacement screens for this phone come pre-installed in a new frame (a.k.a. chassis), which requires a very different procedure. Make sure you have the correct part before starting this guide. Opening the Huawei P20 will damage the splash and dust protection seals on the device. If you do not replace the adhesive seals, your phone will function normally but will lose its protection . Due to the phone’s design, we recommend removing the lithium-ion battery in order to remove the screen and have better access to the components. However, it is possible to remove the screen without removing the battery. Reusing a deformed battery after it has forcefully been removed, is a potential safety hazard. In this case, replace it with a new battery. Before disassembling your phone, discharge the battery below 25% . The battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured, but the chances of that happening are much lower if discharged. You’ll need replacement adhesive to reattach components when reassembling the device. 你所需要的 步骤 1 Rear Glass Before you begin, switch off your phone. Apply a heated iOpener to the back of the phone to loosen the adhesive beneath the back cover. Apply the iOpener for at least two minutes. 1条评论 步骤 2 Secure a suction handle to the bottom of the back cover, as close to the edge as possible. If the phone's rear glass is cracked, the suction handle may not stick. Try lifting it with strong tape , or superglue the suction handle in place and allow it to cure so you can proceed. Lift the back cover with the suction handle to create a small gap between the cover and the frame. Insert an opening pick into the gap. If you have trouble, apply more heat to further soften the adhesive. Follow the iOpener instructions to avoid overheating. Slide the opening pick to the bottom right corner. 步骤 3 Insert a second opening pick and slide it to the bottom left corner to cut the adhesive. Leave the opening picks in place to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 4 Insert a third opening pick at the bottom left corner.

Apply the iOpener for at least two minutes. 步骤 32 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Use one arm of a pair of tweezers to peel up the contact cable of the loudspeaker. 步骤 33 Insert a spudger between the midframe and the right side of the loudspeaker. Use the spudger to pry up the loudspeaker. 步骤 34 Remove the loudspeaker. 步骤 35 Screen Apply a heated iOpener to the screen and all edges of the phone to loosen the adhesive beneath the edges of the LCD screen and digitizer. Apply the iOpener for at least two minutes. 步骤 36 Once the screen is warm to the touch, apply a suction cup to the upper edge of the phone. Pull the suction cup upwards and insert an opening pick in the gap between the display glass and the plastic bezel. Start to cut the adhesive by sliding the opening pick to the top left corner. Make sure you get in the right gap between the display and the plastic bezel . Do not pry between the bezel and the midframe. 步骤 37 Insert a second opening pick and slide it to the top right corner of the phone.

I always have trouble with these things. Sooner or later, if not immediately, any glass or screen I fit this way always lifts up. The adhesives that come with the parts always seem weak. I try B-7000 glue or/and double sided tape, but still it won’t sit tight. Smeargle - Hi Smeargle, the options you already tried are also the ones I’d recommend. When applying new double-sided adhesive I’d also suggest slightly heating the glued area and applying some pressure for a few hours (stack of heavy books overnight might do). Tobias Isakeit - Hey how do you get the huawei sealed back? For it to be waterproof again. Léo Zakri - You either buy a rear glass with seal attached or buy a seal and do it yourself, not sure why the author didn't go over this… jasro - Although I understand the steps, why did you not include steps to install the fresh rear glass? jasro - 嵌入本指南 选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。 单个步骤 完整指南 <iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-123101\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/123101/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-123101\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script> <iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/123101\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> 预览",

The l09 is the single sim and the TL10 is the dual sim… Rafail Petridis - installing a new screen the first time, i was looking at darkness. then, taking it apart again and taking away the protective foil on the back of the screen, it just showed pink/purple colors and started heating up pretty bad around the charging connector. my idea would be a short circuit. any idea what is going wrong and can this still be saved?

Only hiccup was that on my handset the screws holding the casing together (Step 2) were Torx 2 rather than pentalobe, possibly a regional variation. I opted not to remove the loudspeaker (Step 10) as the ribbon cable was firmly stuck down and I worried it would break. This meant I could only cleanly remove the adhesive pad in line with the charging port. I was able to prise out the battery using spudger and screwdriver to scrape the other pad from the phone body. All now reassembled and working properly! Ben Raphael - Overall a very helpful guide . I also had torx screws in mine . The torx screws are tiny , so make sure you have the right screwdriver before starting . We didn’t bother removing the loudspeader assembly either (Step 10) . You can just prise up the ribbon cable (carefully) . Add heat if necessary . Now to the biggest problem . Removing the old battery from the phone . What a nightmare ! It’s really stuck down .We took our time using a hairdryer (no heat gun) , and a flat head screwdriver , and went from one end to the other prising it off gently . It still took about 20 minutes . Saying that . Don’t rush it , as it’s the final stage . Also . If you do use a flat head screwdriver then don’t twist it , as you might damage the casing . Just slide it underneath it applying heat . Total time to remove the old battery was 90 minutes , but about 50 of those were spent just getting the first 2 screws out . 20 minutes to put the new battery in and reassemble . Make sure all flex connectors are properly reseated . Paul - My P8 battery has completely died on me. I cannot believe that to replace a battery, we have to now go to these lengths to do it. There must be a mountain of mobile phones, where the only issue with them is a flat battery. Surely, this cannot be allowed to continue. I know why the manufacturers want to make it hard to simply replace a battery, because it sells more mobile phones. But think of all that wasted technology, where a phone may have lasted just over a 24 month contract before the battery is done. joeninetee - Many thanks for this tutorial. Together we shall beat them! joeninetee - Thank you for a very nice and easy to follow tutorial! I have now replaced my battery with what should be an original battery for the Huawei Ascend P8, battery nr: HB3447A9EBW. For some reason the width of the new battery is a few millimeters smaller than the old one, meaning that it does not fill out the space completely. Has anyone else experienced the same? After having assembled the phone again I experience some weird issues with the battery level dropping from 50%, 60%, 70% or even 100% in an instant. I have tried calibrating the battery by, letting it die completely, recharge it to 100% let it drain completely again and recharge. I have tried different battery calibration apps and a factory reset - nothing helps. I contacted the company I bought the battery from and got a replacement - still same issue. Unfortunately i damaged the original battery when taking it out, so i cant use that as a reference. Any suggestions would be most appreciated!

      "content": "How To Apply Stretch Release Battery Adhesive 简介 This guide shows how to cut and apply new stretch release adhesive strips when you’re replacing a battery. Note: This guide depicts several different phones and batteries during the procedure. Your adhesive application may vary slightly from the photos depicted in this guide, but the method remains the same. 你所需要的 步骤 1 Remove the old adhesive 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Keep track of the approximate location of the old battery adhesive. It may be helpful to take a quick photo to reference later. Begin by removing all of the old adhesive and residue from the adhesion surfaces in the battery well. You can pull the adhesive off with tweezers or your fingers, roll it up on the tip of a spudger with a roll-and-pull motion, or scrape it off with the flat end of a spudger. 步骤 2 Clean the surface Finish cleaning the surface using a lint-free cloth (or coffee filter) and some high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher). Wait at least a minute to let the alcohol evaporate after cleaning. 步骤 3 Inspect your device The following steps show a general use case for the stretch release adhesive strips—locations will vary between phone models. Evaluate what will work for your specific repair before you install the adhesive. With the device powered off, inspect the battery well on your device: Avoid applying adhesive over ribbon cables or delicate surfaces like NFC or wireless charging coils. Avoid applying adhesive too close to sensitive components. 步骤 4 Align the adhesive strips The stretch release adhesive strips will be applied to the rear of the replacement battery, and may need to be cut to length. If you don't need to cut the adhesive strips to length, skip the next two steps. Lay the stretch release adhesive strips next to your replacement battery, aligning the pull tabs slightly above the top edge of the battery. 步骤 5 Using a pen, mark a line on the stretch release adhesive just slightly above the bottom edge of the battery. 步骤 6 Cut the adhesive to length Use a pair of sharp scissors or a razor blade to cut the stretch release adhesive tabs at the marked line. If your scissors are dull, they may gum up the adhesive—you might have to start over with fresh strips. Remove the excess section of adhesive. 步骤 7 Remove the small sections of blue film covering the flat ends of the adhesive strips. Don't remove the entire blue liner, just the small parts covering the pull tabs. 步骤 8 Carefully align the exposed portion of the adhesive strips along the edge of the front of the battery, and press them gently into place. Some devices need to have the battery pull tabs located near the top of the device, and some have them located near the bottom. Evaluate what will work for your repair. Take care to line up the strips correctly the first time. Once they adhere to the battery, they can't be removed and realigned. 步骤 9 Place the battery face down on a flat surface. Starting at the cut end of the adhesive strips, peel off the large blue film covering the strips. Use a pair of tweezers to loosen the blue layer if you have trouble starting near the cut section of adhesive. The blue film sometimes has a defect that prevents it from peeling off, and the strips have to be discarded and replaced. If this happens to you and you got your strips from iFixit, contact us and we'll send you a replacement on the double. In the meantime, you can temporarily reassemble your phone with a bit of double-sided tape to hold the battery. 步骤 10 Using your fingertip, gently roll the adhesive strips over the bottom edge of the battery, toward the back. Don't pull or stretch the strips as you apply them. 步骤 11 Lay the strips down flat on the back of the battery. 步骤 12 Use your fingers or a cloth to press the strips firmly into place along the back of the battery. 步骤 13 Carefully peel away the remaining piece of film, fully exposing the adhesive strips.

How do I tell, apart from the colour, which side goes on the back of the battery? Philip Le Riche - I've worked it out. Comparing the first two photos of Step 5 you can see that the pull tabs have a black stripe on one side but are fully black on the other. The stripe side sticks to the battery as it's all sticky except just for the stripe. The black on the other side is then exposed. Not being sticky, it prevents it from sticking to anything it shouldn't. Philip Le Riche - July 4 2024. Received iFixit battery replacement kit for an iPhone 12 Mini. The adhesive strips were already in place on the back of the battery..

      "content": "Huawei Ascend P6-U06 Screen/LCD Display Replacement 简介 Replace your phone's cracked screen or unresponsive LCD display to give it a fresh appearance. The screen and LCD display are glued on and wired in place, so replacing this part requires patience. Because the screen and LCD display are one piece, replacing one means you are placing both. For your safety, discharge your battery below 25% before disassembling your phone. This reduces the risk of a dangerous thermal event if the battery is accidentally damaged during the repair. 你所需要的 步骤 1 SIM Card Pull and twist the pin near the bottom left-side of the phone to remove it from the headphone jack. 步骤 2 Insert the pin into the SIM card opening located on the right-side of the phone. Gently push in until the SIM card clicks, and then pull the pin and SIM card out.

If damaged, they will require soldering. 步骤 17 Hold down the bottom left corner of the motherboard and slowly lift the right side out of the main frame. Gently wiggle the logic board to release it from the phone. 步骤 18 Earpiece Speaker 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Tweezers $4.99 购买 Use the pointy end of a spudger to wedge underneath the earpiece speaker, and gently pry upward. Use tweezers to remove the earpiece speaker from the frame. There is adhesive holding down the earpiece speaker to the frame. If the earpiece speaker is not breaking free, gently wiggle it until it comes loose. 步骤 19 Screen/LCD Display Use the pointy end of a spudger to peel back and fold down the black plastic cover near the bottom left of the phone. 步骤 20 Use an iSesamo tool to separate the gold wire from the silver metal plate. This piece will not come off completely, but it must be separated in order to remove the display. Be careful not to slice or damage the wire. The wire is attached to the panel with a layer of adhesive, so it will take some effort to remove. 步骤 21 Use a heat gun to loosen the adhesive between the display and frame. Start with the heat gun far away from your hand. Then, slowly move your hand towards the heat gun until the air is warm, but not hot. At this set distance, slowly warm the entire front of the phone. The heat gun can be dangerous to you and to the phone. Avoid placing your hand too close to the end of the gun, as it can burn you. Also avoid heating the bottom plastic panel of the phone because it can melt when exposed to direct heat. 步骤 22 Use the iSeasmo tool to wedge between the screen and the plastic near the bottom right corner of the phone. You must wedge the iSeasmo underneath the white plastic part of the screen, and not just the glass. Run your iSeasmo tool slowly to the left and right to begin separating the display. Run your iSeasmo tool along the right and left edges of the display. Adhesive will be found throughout this process, so you must be patient with the separation. Check the back of the phone once in awhile to make sure you are not cutting any wires. 步骤 23 Once the display is loose enough, gently begin separating it from the bottom of the phone. Work your way up until it is completely removed. Some wires will need to be fed through holes in the plastic before the display can be fully removed. Avoid forcing the screen from the plastic. This can damage the screen along with the internal wiring. Take this step very slowly, and go back to remove any extra adhesive if necessary. 即将完成！ To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order. 结论 To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order. 你已经完成了！ 取消：我没有完成这个指南。 18等其他人完成本指南。 5其他贡献者 Zachary Rose 撰写一个指南 CPSU-AMIDO-F14S4G44 5指南评论 Where did you buy the replacement screen?

      "content": "Huawei P20 Home Button with Fingerprint Sensor Replacement 简介 Use this guide to replace a defective home button with fingerprint sensor in your Huawei P20. Opening the Huawei P20 will damage the splash and dust protection seals on the device. If you do not replace the adhesive seals, your phone will function normally but will lose its protection . Due to the phone’s design, we recommend removing the lithium-ion battery in order to remove the screen and have better access to the components. However, it is possible to remove the screen without removing the battery. Reusing a deformed battery after it has forcefully been removed, is a potential safety hazard. In this case, replace it with a new battery. Before disassembling your phone, discharge the battery below 25% . The battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured, but the chances of that happening are much lower if discharged. You’ll need replacement adhesive to reattach components when reassembling the device. 你所需要的 步骤 1 Rear Glass Before you begin, switch off your phone. Apply a heated iOpener to the back of the phone to loosen the adhesive beneath the back cover. Apply the iOpener for at least two minutes. 1条评论 步骤 2 Secure a suction handle to the bottom of the back cover, as close to the edge as possible. If the phone's rear glass is cracked, the suction handle may not stick. Try lifting it with strong tape , or superglue the suction handle in place and allow it to cure so you can proceed. Lift the back cover with the suction handle to create a small gap between the cover and the frame. Insert an opening pick into the gap. If you have trouble, apply more heat to further soften the adhesive. Follow the iOpener instructions to avoid overheating. Slide the opening pick to the bottom right corner. 步骤 3 Insert a second opening pick and slide it to the bottom left corner to cut the adhesive. Leave the opening picks in place to prevent the adhesive from resealing. 步骤 4 Insert a third opening pick at the bottom left corner.

      "content": "iOpener Instructions 简介 The iOpener is an insulated, heat-retaining bag that can be heated in a microwave and used to transfer heat to the adhesive along the edge of an iPad or similar device. Follow these basic instructions to get started with your new (black, liquid-filled) iOpener. For the white, solid-filled iOpener, follow this guide instead. For detailed instructions specific to your device and repair, see our set of . 你所需要的 步骤 1 iOpener Heating We recommend that you clean your microwave before proceeding, as any nasty gunk on the bottom may end up stuck to the iOpener. Place the iOpener in the center of the microwave. For carousel microwaves: Make sure the plate spins freely. If your iOpener gets stuck, it may overheat and burn. 35条评论 步骤 2 Heat the iOpener for thirty seconds . Depending on the wattage of your microwave, more or less time may be required. The iOpener is sufficiently heated when it's barely too hot to touch. Throughout the repair procedure, as the iOpener cools, reheat it in the microwave for an additional thirty seconds at a time. Be careful not to overheat the iOpener during the repair. Overheating may cause the iOpener to burst. Do not attempt to heat over 100˚C (212˚F). Never touch the iOpener if it appears swollen. If the iOpener is still too hot in the middle to touch, continue using it while waiting for it to cool down some more before reheating. A properly heated iOpener should stay warm for up to 10 minutes. 30条评论 步骤 3 Remove the iOpener from the microwave, holding it by one of the two flat ends to avoid the hot center. The iOpener will be very hot, so be careful when handling it. Use an oven mitt if necessary. 8条评论 步骤 4 Alternate iOpener heating method If you don't have a microwave, follow this step to heat your iOpener in boiling water. Fill a pot or pan with enough water to fully submerge an iOpener. Heat the water to a boil. Turn off the heat. Place an iOpener into the hot water for 2-3 minutes. Make sure the iOpener is fully submerged in the water. Use tongs to extract the heated iOpener from the hot water. Thoroughly dry the iOpener with a towel. The iOpener will be very hot, so be careful to hold it only by the end tabs. Your iOpener is ready for use! If you need to reheat the iOpener, heat the water to a boil, turn off the heat, and place the iOpener in the water for 2-3 minutes. 10条评论 步骤 5 iOpener Instructions Lay the iOpener clear-side down, flat on the edge of the device, over an adhesive seal you wish to heat. The liquid will flatten the iOpener against the surface, ensuring good heat conduction. Let the bag sit on the device for approximately 90 seconds before attempting to open the front panel. At this point you should be able to begin prying under the screen with a plastic opening tool. Be sure to see your device's specific guide for where and how to do this. During the procedure you may need to reheat the iOpener. To prevent overheating the iOpener, always wait until the iOpener has cooled enough to touch safely. Do not microwave the iOpener for more than thirty seconds at a time. 1条评论 即将完成！ 终点 你已经完成了！ 取消：我没有完成这个指南。 644等其他人完成本指南。 8其他贡献者 Andrew Optimus Goldheart iFixit iFixit Staff 47指南评论 I bought two of these, and I can't get an iPad 2 to open using the iOpener; I'm going to keep trying, but heads up, it's not as easy as 1-2-3. I'll update if I get it to work. Kevin McCartney - I used a flat toaster maker and turned it off and on as required, Fixed my Ipad mini ok. Chris Newman - Step 2 says to wait 5 minutes between reheating, step 4 says to wait 3 minutes.

      "content": "iPhone 6s Screen Replacement 简介 Learn how to replace your iPhone 6s screen. This part comes with the front-facing camera, sensor assembly, and EMI shield already installed, making for an easier repair. All you need to do is remove the old screen and transfer the home button to the new screen, in order for Touch ID (fingerprint scanning) to function. 你所需要的 步骤 1 Pentalobe Screws Before disassembling your iPhone, discharge the battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured. Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly. Remove the two 3.4 mm P2 Pentalobe screws on the bottom edge of the iPhone, on either side of the Lightning connector. 37条评论 步骤 2 Tape over the display If your display glass is cracked, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping over the glass. Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's display until the whole face is covered. This will keep glass shards contained and provide structural integrity when prying and lifting the display. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair. If the broken glass makes it difficult to get a suction cup to stick in the next few steps, try folding a strong piece of tape (such as duct tape) into a handle and lifting the display with that instead. 9条评论 步骤 3 Anti-Clamp instructions 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Clampy - Anti-Clamp $24.95 购买 The next two steps demonstrate the Anti-Clamp , a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down three steps for an alternate method. For complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, check out this guide . Pull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms. Slide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone. Position the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone just above the home button—one on the front, and one on the back. Squeeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area. If you find that the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can use tape to create a grippier surface. 2条评论 步骤 4 Pull the blue handle forwards to lock the arms. Turn the handle clockwise 360 degrees or until the cups start to stretch. Make sure the suction cups remain aligned with each other . If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms. Insert an opening pick under the screen when the Anti-Clamp creates a large enough gap. If the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, rotate the handle a quarter turn. Don't crank more than a quarter turn at a time , and wait a few seconds between turns. Let the Anti-Clamp and time do the work for you. Skip the next three steps. 步骤 5 Opening Procedure 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Clampy - Anti-Clamp $24.95 购买 If you don't have an Anti-Clamp , follow the next three steps to use a suction handle. Apply mild heat to the lower edge of the iPhone using an iOpener or hair dryer for about a minute. Heat softens the adhesive securing the display, making it easier to open. 12条评论 步骤 6 Opening the display on the 6s separates a thin strip of adhesive around the perimeter of the display. If you prefer to replace the adhesive, have a set of new adhesive strips ready before you continue. It's possible to complete the repair without replacing the adhesive, and you probably won't notice any difference in functionality. Apply a suction cup to the lower left corner of the display assembly. Take care not to place the suction cup over the home button. If your display is badly cracked, covering it with a layer of clear packing tape may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively, very strong tape may be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the broken screen. 19条评论 步骤 7 Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the front panel and rear case. Take your time and apply firm, constant force. The display assembly is a much tighter fit than most devices and is held down with adhesive. Pulling too hard may damage the display assembly. Apply just enough pressure to create a small gap between the display assembly and the rear case. If you have any trouble, heat the front of the iPhone using an iOpener, hair dryer, or heat gun until it's slightly too hot to touch. This will help soften the adhesive securing the edges of the display. 37条评论 步骤 8 There is a notch on the underside of the display, just above the headphone jack. This is the safest place to begin prying the phone open. Place the flat edge of a spudger into the gap between the screen and rear case, directly above the headphone jack. 7条评论 步骤 9 Twist the spudger to widen the gap between the front panel assembly and the rest of the phone. 4条评论 步骤 10 Insert the flat end of the spudger on the left side of the phone, between the display assembly and rear case. Slide the spudger up the side of the phone to separate the adhesive and pop the clips free. 6条评论 步骤 11 Remove the spudger and reinsert it on the bottom edge, where you pried the phone open. Slide the spudger to the right, along the bottom edge of the phone. 步骤 12 Slide the spudger up the right side to continue separating the adhesive and popping the display clips free from the iPhone. 3条评论 步骤 13 Use the suction cup to open the display, breaking the last of the adhesive. Don't open the display more than 90º, as it is still connected at the top by three cables that may break if stretched. 3条评论 步骤 14 Pull up on the nub on the top side of the suction cup to remove it from the front panel. 1条评论 步骤 15 Gently grasp the display assembly and lift it up to open the phone, using the clips at the top of the front panel as a hinge. Open the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone. Add a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables. In a pinch, you can use an unopened canned beverage to hold the display. 14条评论 步骤 16 Battery Connector 在这个步骤中使用的工具： Magnetic Project Mat $19.95 购买 Remove two Phillips screws securing the battery connector bracket, of the following lengths: One 2.9 mm screw One 2.2 mm screw Throughout this repair, keep track of each screw and make sure it goes back exactly where it came from to avoid damaging your iPhone. 13条评论 步骤 17 Remove the battery connector bracket from the iPhone. 4条评论 步骤 18 Use the point of a spudger to disconnect the battery connector by prying it straight up from the logic board. 11条评论 步骤 19 Push the battery connector away from the logic board until it stays separated from its socket, so as to avoid any accidental connection to the battery while you work. 7条评论 步骤 20 Unfasten the display cable bracket Remove the following four Phillips screws securing the display cable bracket: Three 1.2 mm screws One 2.8 mm screw 37条评论 步骤 21 Remove the display cable bracket. 3条评论 步骤 22 Use a spudger or a clean fingernail to disconnect the front camera flex cable by prying it straight up from its socket on the logic board. 6条评论 步骤 23 Disconnect the digitizer cable by prying it straight up from its socket on the logic board. When reconnecting the digitizer cable, do not press the center of the connector . Press one end of the connector, then press the opposite end. Pressing in the center of the connector can bend the component and cause digitizer damage. 9条评论 步骤 24 Make sure the battery is disconnected before you disconnect or reconnect the cable in this step. Disconnect the display cable by prying it straight up from its socket on the logic board. 15条评论 步骤 25 Remove the display assembly. During reassembly, pause here if you wish to replace the adhesive around the edges of the display . 11条评论 步骤 26 Home Button Assembly Remove the three 1.7 mm Phillips screws securing the home button bracket. Do not over-tighten these screws as these can damage the front of the display. 8条评论 步骤 27 Lift the lower edge of the home button bracket until it clears the small peg on the right side. Slide the bracket out from under the EMI shield to remove it. 3条评论 步骤 28 Use a spudger to disconnect the home button connector by popping it out of its socket on the back of the display panel. 6条评论 步骤 29 在这个步骤中使用的工具： iOpener $24.99 购买 The rubber gasket surrounding the home button is very thin and tears easily.

Já aprendi muito consultando os tutoriais da IFIXIT. Parabéns. Eder Macario - Solution worked very well - a couple of comments: 1. With a cracked screen the suction cup doesn't hold very well, I was nevertheless able to get the screen corner off with some heavy prying above the headphone jack as suggested in step 4. 2. In the replacement part I received, the order of the digitizer and camera cables was reversed, I had to tuck the digitizer cable back under the camera cable to get them down in the correct order. Great pictures and guide from ifixit. stread777 - Agree with both points. The guide is also missing steps (or mention of) moving the camera/sensor/etc to the new digitizer. I didn't think about it until I wondered why the old screen had 3 cables and the new one only had 2. nerdatheart - The guide and photos were great along with the replacement part from iFixit. Probably the easiest screen replacement I've done so far. gotchay - Try putting packing tape in the center of the screen. This will keep the glass chunks in and the suction cup will stick to it.
