    "content": "iOpener Heating\nThe\niOpener\nis an insulated, heat-retaining bag that can be heated in a microwave and used to transfer heat to the adhesive along the edge of an iPad or similar device.\nFollow these basic instructions to get started with your new (black, liquid-filled) iOpener. For the white, solid-filled iOpener, follow\nthis guide\ninstead.\nFor detailed instructions specific to your device and repair, see our set of\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\niOpener Heating\nWe recommend that you clean your microwave before proceeding, as any nasty gunk on the bottom may end up stuck to the iOpener.\nPlace the iOpener in the center of the microwave.\nFor carousel microwaves: Make sure the plate spins freely. If your iOpener gets stuck, it may overheat and burn.\n35条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 2\nHeat the iOpener for\nthirty seconds\nDepending on the wattage of your microwave, more or less time may be required. The iOpener is sufficiently heated when it's barely too hot to touch.\nThroughout the repair procedure, as the iOpener cools, reheat it in the microwave for an additional thirty seconds at a time.\nBe careful not to overheat the iOpener during the repair. Overheating may cause the iOpener to burst. Do not attempt to heat over 100˚C (212˚F).\nNever touch the iOpener if it appears swollen.\nIf the iOpener is still too hot in the middle to touch, continue using it while waiting for it to cool down some more before reheating. A properly heated iOpener should stay warm for up to 10 minutes.\n30条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 3\nRemove the iOpener from the microwave, holding it by one of the two flat ends to avoid the hot center.\nThe iOpener will be very hot, so be careful when handling it. Use an oven mitt if necessary.\n8条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 4\nAlternate iOpener heating method\nIf you don't have a microwave, follow this step to heat your iOpener in boiling water.\nFill a pot or pan with enough water to fully submerge an iOpener.\nHeat the water to a boil.\nTurn off the heat.\nPlace an iOpener into the hot water for 2-3 minutes. Make sure the iOpener is fully submerged in the water.\nUse tongs to extract the heated iOpener from the hot water.\nThoroughly dry the iOpener with a towel.\nThe iOpener will be very hot, so be careful to hold it only by the end tabs.\nYour iOpener is ready for use! If you need to reheat the iOpener, heat the water to a boil, turn off the heat, and place the iOpener in the water for 2-3 minutes.\n10条评论\n添加一条评论\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n359等其他人完成本指南。\n11其他贡献者\nAndrew Optimus Goldheart\niFixit\niFixit\nStaff\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n小——600像素\n中——800像素\n大——1200像素\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-25705\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/25705/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-25705\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/25705\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"

    "content": "Huawei P40 Pro Screen Replacement\nUse this guide to remove or replace the screen on your Huawei P40 Pro.\nIf the frame is deformed, it's important to replace it to make sure the new screen will mount correctly and won’t suffer damage from uneven pressure.\nDue to the device’s design, you must remove the lithium-ion battery to access the display cables. If the battery was deformed during removal replace it with a new one—reusing a deformed battery is a potential safety hazard.\nBefore disassembling your device,\ndischarge the battery below 25%\n. The battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured, but the chances of that happening are much lower if discharged.\nNote: This guide instructs you to replace only the screen while leaving the original frame and motherboard in place.

Apply the iOpener for at least two minutes.\nThe protective adhesive of the P40 Pro is very strong and hard to cut. It is likely that you have to reapply the iOpener after each of the following steps to soften the adhesive enough to cut it.\nA hair dryer, heat gun, or hot plate may also be used, but be careful not to overheat the device.\nSince the rear camera module sticks out of the midframe, we recommend placing a lint free cloth or similar underneath the camera module during  the following steps in order to avoid damaging the lenses.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 25\nInsert an iFlex\nSince the screen of the Huawei P40 Pro is curved, we highly recommend slicing the adhesive with a flexible tool like the iFlex before working with opening picks to prevent the display glass from shattering.\nOnce the screen is warm to touch, apply a suction cup to the bottom edge of the screen.\nIf your screen is badly cracked, covering it with a layer of clear packing tape may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively,\nvery strong tape\nmay be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the screen.\nLift the screen with the suction handle to create a small gap between the screen and the frame.\nInsert an iFlex in the gap between the midframe and the screen.\nSlide the iFlex to the bottom left corner of the screen to slice its adhesive.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 26\nInsert an opening pick\nInsert an opening pick next to the bottom left corner of the screen to prevent the adhesive from resealing.\nDo not insert the opening pick right at the corner.

Just how far did Huawei go to imitate (and perhaps surpass?) the iPhone? Time to tear this sucker down and find out.\nAs always, stay up to date on the latest tech happenings by following us on\nFacebook\nInstagram\n, or\nTwitter\n你所需要的\n本篇指南是分解流程而\n非维修指南\n。 如果您要维修您的Huawei P9，应参考我们的\n维修指南\n步骤 1\nHuawei P9 Teardown\nHuawei made\nan iPhone\na luxury unibody phone. Are the specs as pretty as the case?\n5.2\" 1080 x 1920 (~423 ppi) IPS-NEO LCD\nHuawei Kirin 955 Octa-core CPU (4x 2.5 GHz Cortex-A72 + 4x 1.8 GHz Cortex-A53) and Mali-T880 MP4 GPU\nDual 12 MP, f/2.2, 27 mm, Leica optics, dual-LED flash; 8 MP front-facing camera\n32 or 64 GB internal storage, expandable via MicroSD (up to 128 GB additional)\nRear-case-mounted fingerprint sensor\nAndroid 6.0 Marshmallow\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 2\nHuawei beat Apple to the smooth-rear-case-punch, offering a slim phone, without the infamous\ncamera bump\nAntenna bands, chamfered edges, brushed aluminum and—Pentalobes? The P9 seems to have taken the iPhone design as law, down to the nasty proprietary five-lobed screws.\nThis marks the first time we've seen such a tiny pentalobe screw outside the Apple ecosystem; we can only hope this is an outlier, not a trend.\nSeriously, there's no good reason to use pentalobe screws. They are shallow and have round lobes, making them excessively easy to strip. The\nonly\nreason to use them is to prevent the average user from getting them out.\n2条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 3\nFollowing our iPhone design hunch, we break out the iSclack, just in case there's a\nsneaky fingerprint sensor cable trap\nTurns out Huawei fixed that too! A long accordion-like cable allows the rear case to be almost entirely separated from the rest of the phone, making disconnection easy.\nA little heat and some prying earns us a\nsomewhat familiar-looking\nfingerprint sensor.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 4\nBrackets and screws start flying as we dig right in, disconnecting the battery for starters.\nFirst to fall: the 8 MP, ƒ/2.4, selfie cam, its connector secured by some simple tape.\nThe  front-facing camera is cute (and packs a pixel-dense punch), but we're\nreally\nafter its big brother(s).\nWe're\nslightly\nbummed we didn't get to test out the fancy software features that compliment this hardware. The Perfect Selfie will have to wait.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 5\nThe fancy dual-rear-facing camera is on a single ribbon cable, making it easy to pluck free.\nThis (\npurportedly impressive\n) dual camera unit is made up of two image sensors: An ordinary 12 MP RGB sensor, and a 12 MP monochrome sensor.\nThe additional monochrome sensor aims to add depth and contrast to color photos (while functioning as a nice black-and-white camera, too).\nThe dual-camera assembly is noticeably shorter than the bump-inducing iPhone 6s camera, but not by much.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 6\nWho left their gum in here?

But it looks a bit like an afterthought, if you ask us.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 14\nPulling at some familiar black tabs we are elated to find adhesive pull tabs under the P9's battery.\nWe can't praise these tabs enough. They are an easy-to-use and inexpensive way to secure the battery in a reversible manner.\nAnd a good thing, too—with those two orange interconnect cables under the battery, prying through thick adhesive easily could have been dangerous for Mr. P9's health.\nHuawei lists a couple specs for their battery: A \"rated capacity\" of 11.08 Wh and a \"typical capacity\" a bit higher at 11.46 Wh.\nThat puts the P9 battery ahead of the\niPhone 6s Plus\n's 10.45 Wh and just under the\nSamsung Galaxy S7\n's 11.55 Wh battery.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 15\nHuawei P9 repairability score:\n7 out of 10\n(10 is easiest to repair):\nModular components with spring contacts, thoughtful cabling, and minimal adhesive all make repair cheaper and easier.\nThe battery is straightforward to access. Removing it requires knowledge of the adhesive removal technique, but is not difficult.\nThe display assembly is a fused unit, and replacement requires near complete disassembly of the phone.\nThe P9 inexplicably uses Pentalobe security screws on the exterior, requiring a specialty screwdriver to open the phone.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n10其他贡献者\nTobias Isakeit\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n小——600像素\n中——800像素\n大——1200像素\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-62348\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Teardown/embed/62348/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-62348\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Teardown/embed/62348\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"

The battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured, but the chances of that happening are much lower if discharged.\n你所需要的\n步骤 1\nBack Cover\nFirst switch off your phone and remove the SIM card tray.\nUnscrew the two Pentalobe P2 screws located at the bottom next to the device's USB C port.\nIf the screen is cracked you might want to use some tape to protect your eyes from glass shreds and get a better grip to open the phone.\n3条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 2\nAvoid to lift only the display instead of the whole phone assembly as doing so may cause damage to the screen.\nUse an iSclack or a suction handle to separate the phone assembly from the rear panel.\nIn case you can‘t manage to lift the phone assembly out of the rear panel you can insert the pointed end of a spudger in the headphone jack opening and press the phone assembly upwards until you create a gap between assembly and rear panel.   Then use the spudger to lever the phone assembly out of the panel.\nDon't remove the rear panel completely yet. There is a cable connected to it! It is running from the finger print sensor to the display unit.\n21条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 3\nFingerprint sensor\nDisconnect the fingerprint sensor using a spudger.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 4\nBattery\nUnplug the antenna cable.\nRemove the sticker that sits on top of the screw.\n1条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 5\nUnscrew the two Phillips #00 screws that hold the metal plate in place.\nThe plate, which is covering the battery connector, has two little hooks on each side. Use a tweezer to free them and unhinge the plate by carefully moving it upwards.\n2条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 6\nNow you can unplug the battery connector and bend it aside.\nThe EVA-L09 model has an NFC antenna adhered onto the battery.\nIf you are just removing the battery to get to the display, you can leave the NFC on the battery.\nMark its place on the battery with a felt pen for reassembly. Carefully peel it off and make sure not to rip or crease the antenna.\nFor reassembly, place the NFC antenna on the battery where it was before so its contacts align with their counterparts.\n2条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 7\nFree the ends of the adhesive pull tabs to get a good grip on them.\n添加一条评论\n添加一条评论\n步骤 8\n在这个步骤中使用的工具：\nTesa 61395 Tape\n$5.99\nThe battery is secured with three pieces of adhesive, a removable pull-tab in the center, and on the SIM tray side. A third piece of adhesive on the button side has no pull-tab.\nPull the adhesive tabs in a slow constant movement  to free the battery.\nShould those adhesive tabs snap, you might want to use an iOpener to heat and soften them a little bit so you can pry out the battery with a spudger.\nThere are two cables running directly underneath the battery. Take care not to damage them when prying with a spudger! You can see their position in the last picture.\nSlowly lift the battery toward the button side and free it from the remaining hidden piece of adhesive.\nWhen reassembling your phone, replace old adhesive with\nstretch release adhesive strips\ndouble-sided tape\n, or\npre-cut adhesive strips\n21条评论\n添加一条评论\n即将完成！\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\n你已经完成了！\n取消：我没有完成这个指南。\n92等其他人完成本指南。\n8其他贡献者\nTobias Isakeit\nTobias Isakeit - Repairability Engineer\nTobias Isakeit - Repairability Engineer\nBusiness\n嵌入本指南\n选择一个尺寸并复制下面的代码，将本指南作为一个小插件嵌入到你的网站/论坛中。\n单个步骤\n完整指南\n小——600像素\n中——800像素\n大——1200像素\n<iframe id=\"dozuki-embed-77706\" src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/77706/full\" width=\"800\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<script>window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){var b=document.getElementById(\"dozuki-embed-77706\"),c=a.data[0],d=a.data[1];switch(c){case\"setHeight\":b.style.height=d+\"px\"}},!1);</script>\n<iframe src=\"https://zh.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/77706\" width=\"800\" height=\"584\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
